elementa are combined in very unequal proportions. All these
remarks, however, will be annecessary to those who are satis·
fied with the will of the Lord. For if it be his pleasure to
appoint kings over kingdoms, aud senators or other magistrates
over free cities, it is our duty to be obedient to any govemors
whom God has established over the places in which we reside.
lX. Here it is necessary to state in a brief manner the nature
of the office of magistracy‚ as described in the word of God,
aud wherein it consists. If the Scriptura did not tcach that
this office extends to both tables of the law, wc might learu it
from heathen writers; for not one of theru has treated of the
office of magistrates, of legislation‚ and civil govemment, with-
out beginning with religion and Divine worship. And thus
they have all consessed that no government cau be happily ”
constituted, unless its first object be the promotion of piety‚
and that all laws are preposterous which neglect the claims of
God, and merely provide for the interests of men. Therefore‚
as religion holds the first place among all the philosophers, and
as this has always been regarded bytho universal consent of
all nations, Christian princes and magistrates ought to be
ashamed of their indolence, if they do not malre it the object
of their most serious care. We have already shown that this
duty is particularly enjoined upon them by God; for it is rea·

and defending the honour of him, whose vicegerents they are,
and by whose favour they govern. And the principal com·

having restored the worship of God when it had been corrupted
or abolished, or for having devoted their attention to religion,
that it might flourish in purity and safety under their reigns.
On the contrary, the sacred history represents it as one of the
evils arising frorn anarchy, or a want of good govemment, thet
when “ there was no king in lsrael, every man did that which
was right in his own eyes.’' (a) These things evincc the folly
of those who would wish magistrates to neglect all thoughts of
God, and to confine themselves entirely to the administratiou
of justice among men, as though God appointed governors in
his name to decide secular controversies‚ and disregarded that
which is of far greater importance -the pure worship of himself
according to the rule of his law. But a rage for universal in·
novation, and a desire to escape with impunity, instigate men
os turbulent spirits to wish that all the avengers of violated
piety were removed out of the world. With respect to tha
second table, Jeremiah admonishes kings in the following
manner: “Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and de·
