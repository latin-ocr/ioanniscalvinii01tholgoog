which hohas promised, and that they constitute the road in
which we should traval to endeavour to attain the blessed hope
proposed ιο us in heaven, therefore the fruit of the promises, ιο
the perfection of which fruit those works conduct us, is justly
assigned to them. 'Phe apostle beautifully expressed both those
ideas, when he said that the Colossians applied themselves to
the duties of charity, “ for the hope which was laid up for
them in heaven, whereof they heard before in the word, of the
trnth of the gospel.'' (z) For his assertion, that they knew
from the gospel, that there was hope laid up for thern in hea-
ven, is equivalent ιο a declaration that it depended not on any
works, but on Christ alone 3 which perfectly accords with thc
observation of Peter, that believers “ are kept by the power of
God through saith unto salvation, ready ιο be revealed in the
last time.¹’ (a) When it is said that they must labour for it, it
implies, that in order ιο attain to it, believers have arace ιο run,
which terminatas only with their lives. But that we might
not suppose the reward promised us by the Lord to be regula·
ted according ιο the proportion of merit, he proposes a parable,
in which he has represented himself under the character of a
householder, who employs all the persons he meets in the cui-
tivation of his vineyard3 some lre hires at the first honr
of the day, others at the second, others at thc third, and some
even at the eleventh hour; in the cvening he pays them all
the same wagcs.(b) A brief and just explanation of this
parable is given by the ancient writer, whoever he was, of the
treatise “ On the Calling of the Gentiles,'' which bears the
name of Ambrose. ishall adopt his words in preference to
my own. “By the example of this comparison, (says he,) the
Lord has shown a variety of manifold vocation pertaining to
the same grace. They who, having been admitted into the
vineyard at the eleventh honr, are placed on an equality with
them who had laboured the whole day, represent the state of
those whom, to magnify the excellence of grace, God, in his
mercy, has rewarded in the decline of the day, and at the con·
clusion of lite3 not paying them the weges due to their labour,
but sending down the riches of his goodncss, in copious etlu-
sions, on them whom he has chosen without works3 that even
they who have labourcd the most, and have received no more
than the last, may understand theirs to be a reward of grace,
not of worlts.'' Lastly, it is also worthy of being observed,
that in those places where eternal life is called a reward of
works, it is not to be understood simply of that communion
which we have with God, as the prolude to a happy immor-
tality, when hc embraces us in Christ with paternal benevo-
