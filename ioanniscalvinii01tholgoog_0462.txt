see that there is never any sacmmeut without nn mitecedent
promise os God, to which it is subjoined aa un appendix, in
order to confirm and seul the promise itself, und to certisy ond
misy it to us; which means God soresees to be necessary, in
the first place on account os our ignor-mee and dulness, md in the
next pleae on account os our weaknese 5 und yet, strictly speak-
ing, not so much sor the confirmation of his sacred word, u
for our establishment in the saith os it. For the truth os God
is sufficiently solid end certain in itsels, und can receive no
better confirmation from any other quurter than from itsels3
but our saith being slender ond weolr, unless it be supported

the pope, therefore, involves a gross prosunation σι’ the myste-
