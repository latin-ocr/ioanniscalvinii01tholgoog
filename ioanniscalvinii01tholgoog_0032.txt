wise men of learning and piety, that good works merit the
graees which are conferred on us in this life, and that eternal
salvation is the reward of saith alone3 because the Lord almost
always places the reward of labours and the crown of victory
in heaven. Resides, to ascribe the accumulation of graces
upon greces, given us by the Lord, to the merit of worlrs, in
such a manner as to detract it from grace, is contrary to tha
doctrine of the Scriptura. For though Christ says, that “to
every one that hath shall be given,” and that “the good and
faithful servant, who hath been faithful over a few things, shall
be made ruler over many things,” (r) yet he likewise shows
in another place, that the improvements of believers are the
gifts of his gratuitous kindness. “ Hc, every one that thirst·
eth,'’ says he, “come ye to the waters, and ho that hath no
money, come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine and
milk without money and without price.'' (s) Whatever, there·
fore, is now conferred on believers to promote their salvation
as wellas their future blessedness, flows exclusively from the
beneficencc of God3 nevertheless he declares, that beth in the
latter and in the former, he has respect to our works, because,
to demonstrate the magnitude of his love to us, he dignifies
with such honour, not only otuselves, but even the gifts which
he has bestowed on us.

V. If these points had been handled and digested in proper
order in former ages, there would never have arisen ao many
debates and dissensions. Paul says, that in erecting the super·
structure of Christian doctrine, it is necessary to retain that
foundation which he had laid among the Corinthiam, other
than which no man can lay, which is Jcsus Christ. (t) What
kind of a foundation have we in Christ? Has he begun our
salvation, that we may complete it ourselves? and has he
merely opened a way sor us to proeeed in by our own powers?
By no means ; but, as the apostlc before stated, when we ac-
lmowlcdge him, he is “made unte us righteousness.” (u) No
⁴ man, therefore, is properly founded on Christ, ,but he who has
complete righteousness in him ; since the apostlc says, that he
was sent, not to assist usin the attainment os righteousness,
but to be himself our righteousness; that is -to say, that we
were chesen in him from etemity,before the formation of the
world, not on account of any merit of ours,1but according to
the purpose of the Divine will ; (to) that by the death of Christ
vve are redeemed from the sentence es death, and liberated from
perdition, (a) that in him we are adopted as sons and heirs by
the heavenly Father, (y) to whom we have been reconciled by
