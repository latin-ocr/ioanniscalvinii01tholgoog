is still, therefore, present, and will always continue present
with the Church. With a view to show us the manner in
which he manifeste himself, Paul calls our attention to the
offices which he employs. There is “one Lord,” he says, “ in
you all. But unto every one of usis given grece according

to preside over all as his vicegerentl For his subject abso·
lutely required it, and it ought by no means to have been
omitted, if it had been true. “Christ,'’he says, “is present
with us.'’ How? “By the ministry of men whom he has
appointed to the govcmment of the Church.” Why not
rather, “By the ministerial head, to whom he bes delegated
his authority l '' He mentions a nnity3 bnt it isin God, and
in the saith of Christ. He attributes nothing to rnen butacom·

that commendation of unity, after having said, “ There is one
body, one Spirit, one hope of your calling, one Lord, one saith,
one baptism,” (r) why has he not likewise immediately added,

Let that passage be duly considered. There is no doubt that
he intends there a representation of the sacred and spiritual
govemment of the Church, which hes since received the name
of hierarcby. Monarchy among ministers, or the govemment
of one over all the rest, he not only does not mention, but
indicates that there is no such thing. There is no doubt also
that he meant to express the nature of the union, by which the
faithful are connected with Christ their Head. Now, he not
only makes no mention of any ministerial head, but attri-
butes to every oue of the membersa particular operation, ac·
cording to the measure of grace distributed to each. Nor is
there any foundation for their far-fetched argument from a
comparison of the heavenly and earthly hierarchy; for, in judg·
ing of the former, it is not safe to go beyond the discoveries
of the Scriptura, end in constituting the latter, it is not right
to follow any other model than that which the Lord himself
has delineated in his word.

which they will never obtain from judicions persons, that the
primacy of the Church was established in Peter, and to be
continued by a perpetual succession, how will they prove that
its seat was fixed at Rome, so that whoever is bishop of that
