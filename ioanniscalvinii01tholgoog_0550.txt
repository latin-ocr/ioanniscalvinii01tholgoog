necessary to unmask such subtleties: not that it is my inten-
tion to enter on a professed examination of the whole os this
subject at present ; I shall only lay the foundations of the dis·
cussion‚ which will follow in its proper place. They maintain
the body of Christ, therefore, to be invisible and infinite, that
it may be concealed under the bread; because they suppose it
to be impossible sor them to partake of him, any otherwise
than by his descending into the breed, but they know nothing
of that descent of which we have spoken, by which he elevatas
usto himself. They bring forward every plausible pretext that
they can; but when they have said all, it is evident that they
are contending for a local presence of Christ. And what is the
reasonof it? Itis because they cannot conceive of any other
participation of his fiesh and blood, except what would consist
in local conjunction and contact, or in some gross enclosure.
XVll. And to defend with obstinacy the error which they
have once embraced, some of theru hesitate not to affirm that
the body of Christ never had any other dimensions than the
whole extent of heaven and earth. His birth asan infant, his
growth to maturity, his extension on the orosS, his incarceration
in the sepulchra-all this, they say, took place in consequence
of a kind of dispensation, that he might as a man accomplish
every thing necessary to our salvation. His appearance in
the same corporeal form after his resurrection, his ascension
to heaven, his subsequent appearances to Stephon and to Paul,
-all this also resulted from a similar dispensation, that he
might manifest himself to the view of man asappointed King in
heaven. Now, what is this but to raise Marcion from the dead?
For if such were the condition of Christ's body, every one
must perceive it to have been a mere phantom or visionary form,
without any real substance. Some plead, with a little more sub·
tlety, that the body of Christ, which is given in the sacrament, is
glorious and immortal, and that therefore it involves no absurdity,
if it be contained under the sacrament in various places, or in no
place,or without any form. But I ask what kind of body did
Jesus Christ give to his disciples, the night before he suffered?
Do not the words imply, that he gave thern the same mortal
body which was just about to be betrayed? 'Phey reply, that
he had already manifested his glory in the eyes of three of his
disciples, on the mount. That is true; but his design was, in
that splendour, to give them a transient glimpse of his immortal-
ity. They will not find there a twofold body, but the very same
which Christ was accustomed to carry about with him, adorned
with unusual glory, from which it speedily retunred to its
natural condition. When he distributed his body at the insti.-
