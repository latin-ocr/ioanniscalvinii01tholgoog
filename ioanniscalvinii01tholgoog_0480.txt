to attest his veracity to the fathers, as he does to us now in
baptism and the sacred supper, but to represent the compara·
tive superiority of what has been given to us, that no one might

wonder at the ceremonies of the law having been abolished at
the advent of Christ.

XXIII. I will just observa by the way, that the doctriua of
the schools‚ which asserts such a wide difference between the
sacraments of the old and new laW, as though the former
merely prefigured the grace of God, and the latter actually com·
municated it, ought to be altogether exploded. For the apostle
speaks in a manner equally as honourable of the former as of
the latter, when he states that the fathers, in the tIme of
Moses, “did all eat the sanie spiritual meat” (l) with ua, and
explains that meat to be Christ. Who will dare to call that
an empty sign, thch exhibited to the Jews the real com·
murrion of Christ? And the state of the case, thch the
apostle is there discussing, is clearly in favour of our argu·
ment. Por, that no man might dare to despise the judgmerrt
of Geel, in a reliance on a speculative knowledge of ChrIst, aod
the mere name of Christianity, with its external signs, he ex-
hibits the examples of DIvine severity displayed among the
Jews, to teach us that the same punishments which they
suffered aweit us, if we indulge in the same sins. Now, that
the comparison might be pertinent, it was necessary to show
that there was no inequality between us and them in those
privileges of which he forbids us to Indulge unfounded boasts.

· First, therefore, he shows them to have been equal to us ln the
sacramente, and leaves not a partIcle of superiority capable of
exciting in our miuds the least hope of impunity. Nor is it
right to attribute to our baptism any thing more than he attri-
butes to clrcumcision, when he calls it “a seal of the righteous-
ness of faith.” (m) Whatever Is presented to us iu the present
day in our sacraments, was anciently received by the Jews in
theirs-even Christ and his spiritual riches. Whatever power
our sacraments have, they also experienced the same ln theirs:
they were seals of the DIvine benevolence to them, confirming
their hope of eternal salvati0n. If the advocates of the opiu-
ion which we are opposing had been slrilful iuterpreters of the
Epistle to the Hebrews, they would not have been so deceived; Ι
but when they read there that sins were not expiated by the
legal ceremonias, and that the ancient shadows had no power to
confer righteousness‚-neglectIng the comparison intended to
be drawn, and confiuIng their attention to this siugle consider·
atlon, that the law in itself was unprofitable to its observem,
they have simply concluded that the figures were destitute af
