, fore 1 gave no command, but intended to suggest to you such

things as appeared to be nseful.’' By extending his Junsdrc·
tion, as he does, without any limita, the pope dossa grievous
and atrocious injury, not only to other bishops, but toall other
Churcbes, which he distracts and divides by such conduct, in
order to establish his own see upon their ruins· But when he
exempta himself from all the judgmeuts of othere, aud deter-
mines to reign iu such a tyrannical manner as to bave uo law
but his own pleasure, this is certainly so nnbecomiug, and
foreign from the order of the Ohurch, that it is altogether intoler-
able, and incapable of any defende. For itis utterly repugnant,
not only to every sentiment of piety‚ but even os humanity.

XXII. But that l may not be obliged to pursue and discuss
every particular point, l again appeal to those of my contempo-
raries, who would be considered as tho most able aud faithful
advocates of the Roman see, whether they are not ashamed to
defend the present state of the Papacy, whichis evidently a
hundred times more corrupt than it was in the times of Gregory
· and Bemard‚ bnt which even then so exceedingly displeased
those holy men. Gregory every where complains, that he was
excessively distracted with occupatione unsuitable to his office;
that under the narne of being abishop, he was carried back to tha
world ; that he was involved in secular cares, to a greater extent
than he could remember to have been while he was a laymau;
that he was oppressod with the tumult of worldly business, so
that his mind was incapacitated for any elevatiou towards things
above; that he was tossed about with numerous causes like so
many waves, aod disquieted with the tempests of a tumultuous
life, so that he might justly say, “1 am coma into the depth of
the sea.” Amidst these worldly avocatious, howevea he could
still instaret the people by public praachiug, give private ad·
monitiou aud reproof to those who required it, regulata bis
Ohurch‚ give advice to his colleagues, and exhort them to their
duty3 beside these things, he had some time last for writing;
yet he deplores his calamity, in being pluuged into the depth
of the sea lf the administration of that age was a sea, what
must be said of the Papacy in its present state? For what
resemblance is there between them? Here we find no sermons
preached, no attention to discipline, no concern for the Churches,
no spiritual fonction· performed; in a word, nothing bnt the

world. Yet this labyrintn is praised, as though nothing could
be found better constituted, or better administered. What

complaints are poured out by Beruard, what lamentatione does
he utter, when he beholds the vices of his times? What would

he say, then, ifhe eordd behold thisonr iron, or, if possible, worse
thau fron age? What impudenoe is it, not only pertinaciously
to defendas sacred and Divina what all the holy fathers have
