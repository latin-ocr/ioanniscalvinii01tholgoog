the word of the Lord, and preserve the ministry which Christ
bas instituted for the purpose of preaching it. In this Clrurch
are included many hypocritas, who have nothing of Christ but
the name and appearance ; many persons ambitious, avaricious,
envious, slanderous, and dissolute in their lives, who are tole·
rated for a time, either because they cannot be convicted by a
legitimate process, or because discipline is not always maintained
with sufficient vigour. As it is necessary, therefore, to believe
that Ohurch, which is invisible ιο us, and known to God alone,
so this Ohurch, which is visible to meu, we are commanded to
honour, and to maintaiu communion with it.

VIII. As far, therefore, as was important for usto know it,
the Lord has described it by certam marks and characters. It
is the peculiar prerogativa of God himself ιο “know them that
arc his,” (o) as we have already stated from Paul. And to guard
egelnst human presumption ever going to such an extreme, the
experience of every day teachcs us hcw very far his secret judg·
ments transcend all our apprehensione. For those who scemed
the most abandoned, and were generally considered past all hope,
are recalled by his goodness into the right way3 while some,
who seemed to stand better than others, fall Into perdition.
“According to the secret predestination of God,” therefore, ss
Augustine observes, “there are many sheep without the pale
of the Church, and many wolves within.’' For he knows and
ceals those who know not either him or themselves. Of those
who extemally bear his seal, his eyes alone can discam who
are unfeignedly holy, and will persevera ιο the end; which
is the completion of salvation. On the other hand, as he saw
it ιο be in some measure requisita that we should know who
ought to be considered as his children, he has in this respect
accommodated himself to our capacity. And as it was not
necessary that on this point we should have an assirrance of
saith, he has substituted iu its place ajudgment of charity,
according to which we ought to aclmowledge ss members of
the Ghurch all those who by a confession of faith, an exemplary
life, and a participation of the sacramente, profess the sanic God
arrd Christ with ourselves. But the knowledge of the body
itself being more necessary to our salvation, he has distin·
guished it by more clear and certain characters.

IX. Hence the visible Ghurch rises conspicuous to our view.

For wherever we find the word of God purely preached and
heard, and the sacramenta administered according to the insti·
tution of Christ, there, it is not to be doubted, is a Church of
Gon, for his promise can never decere- “ where two or three
are gathered together in my name, there am I in the -midst of
