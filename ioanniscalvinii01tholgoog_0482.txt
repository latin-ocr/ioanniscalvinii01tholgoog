things, and that the worshippers could never attain perfectiori

from the Mosaic ceremonies.” (r) l repeat what 1 have already
suggested, that Paul called the ceremonies shadows, not as if
they had nothing solid in them, but because their accomplish·
ment had been deferred till the manifestation of Christ. In
the next place, I remark that this is to be understood, not of
the efficacy of the ceremonies, but rather of the mode of repre·
sentation. For till Christ was manifested iu the flesh, all the
signs prefigured him as absent; however, he displayed his
power, and consequently himself, as present in the hearts of
believers. But the principal thing to be observed is, that in all
these places Paul is not speaking of the subject, considered
simply in itself, but with reference to those against whom he
is contending. As he was combating the false apostles, who
maintained piety to consist in the ceremonies alone, without
any regard to Christ,-nothing more was necessary for their
confutation, thau to discuss what value ceremonies possessos
themselves. This also was the object pursued by the author of
the Epistle to the Hebrews. Let us remember, therefore, that
the question here does not respect ceremonies, taken in their true
and natural signification, butas distorted by a false and perverse
interpretation, the controversy is not about the legitimate use,
but the superstitious abuse of them. What wonder, then, is it,
if ceremonies, separated from Christ, are divested ot‘ all their
virtue? For all signs are reduced to nothing, when the thing
signified is taken away. So when Christ was addressing those
who supposed the manna to have been mere food for the body,
he accommodated his discourse to their gross notiori, and said
that he would give them better food, to nourish their souls
with the hope of immortality. (s) lf a clearer solution be re-
quired, all that has been said may be comprised in these three
observatious: first, that all the ceremonies of the law of Mo·
ses, unless they were directed to Christ, were vain and useless;
secondly, that they had reference to Christ, so that when he
was manifested in the flesh, they received their accomplish·
ment; lastly‚ that it was necessary for them to be abolished
at his advent, as a shadow vanishes in the clear light of the
sun. But as l defer the more extended discussion of this sub-
ject to the chapter in which 1 intend to compare baptism with δ’
circumcision, 1 touch the more briefly upon it here.

XXVI. It is possible that these miserable sophists have
been led into this error by the extravagant encomiums on the
sacramente which are found in the writings of the fathers ;
as when Augustino says, that “the sacramenta of the old law
only promised the Saviour, but ours give salvatiou.'' Not
