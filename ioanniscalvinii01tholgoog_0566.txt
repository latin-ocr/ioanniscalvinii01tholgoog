be with them by his spiritual presence ; ’' which clearly distin-
guishes the substance of the flesh from the power of the Spirit,
which conjoins us with Christ, notwithstanding we are widely
separated from him by local distance. He frequently uses the
same mode of expression, as when he says, “Christ will come
again, in his corporeal presence, to judge the living and the
dead, according to the rnle of saith and sound doctrine. For
in his spiritual presence, he was to come to his disciples, and to
be with his whole Church on earth, to the end of time. This
discourse, therefore, was addressed to the believers, whom he
had already begun to heep with his corporeal presence, and
whom he was about to leave by his corporeal absence, that
with the Father he might keep thern by his spiritual presence.''
Το explain corporeal to mean visible, is mere trifling; for he
opposes the body of Christ to his Divine power; and by add·
ing, “that wita tlte Fathcr lte might lceep them,’' clearly
expresses that the Saviour communicares his grace to ns froin
heaven hythe Holy Spirit.

XXIX. As they place so much confidenee in this subterfuge s

of an invisible presence, let us see how far it serves their cause.
In the first place, they cannot produce a single syllable from
the Scriptures to prove that Christ is invisible3 but they take
for granted, what no man of sound judgment will concede to
them, that the body of Christ cannot be given in the supper,
without being concealed under the form of bread. NoW, so far
is this from being an admitted axiom, that it is the very point
in dispute between them and us. And while they talk in this
way, they are constrained to attribute to Christ a double body,
because, upon their principle, he is visible in heaven, aud at
the same time, by a special dispensation, is invisible in the
sacred supper. Whether this is correct or not, it is easy to
judge from various passages of Scriptum, and particularly from
the testimony of Peter; who says of Christ, that “the hea-
vens must receive him, until the times of restitution of all
things.” (i) These men maintain that he is in all places, but
without any form. They object that it is unreasonable to
subject the nature of a glorified body to the laws of common
nature. But this objection leads to the extravagant notion of
Servatus, which justly deserves the detestation of all believers,
that the body of Christ, after his ascension, was absorbed in his
Divinity. lwill not essert, that they hold this opinion; but
if it be considered as one of the attributes of the glorified body,
to fill all places in an invisible manner, it is evident that the
corporeal substance must be destroyed, and no difference will
be left between the Divinity and the humanity. Besides, if
