XVII. Why do l multiply quotations? This form of ex·
pression is perpetually occurring in the Scripturas. And even
while the people were kept under the external discipline of
the law, it was sufficiently declared by the prophets that those
carnal sacrifices contained a reality and truth which is common
to the Christian Church, as well as to the nation os the Jews.
For this reason David prayed, “ Let my prayer be set forth be·
fore thee as incense ; and the lifting up os my hands as the even·
ing sacrifice.’' (ro) And Hosea called thanlrsgivIngs “ the calvos
of our lips,” (a) which David calls “ offering thanksgIving ” and
“ offering praise.'’ (y) In imitation os the Psalmist, the apostle
himself says, “ Let us offer the sacrifice os praise to God con·
tinually ;” and by way os explanation adds, “that is, the fruit
os our lips,” consessing or giving “ thanlrs to his name.''(z) ,
This lriud os sacrifica is indispensable in the supper os the Lord,
in which, while we commemorate and declare his death, and
give thanhs, we do no other than offer the sacrifice os praise.
From this sacrificial employment, all Christians are called “a
royal priesthood ; ⁷’ (a) because, as the apostle says, “By Christ
we offerthe sacrifice os praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips,
giving thanks to his name.'' For we do not appear ln the pre·
sence os God with our oblations without an intercessor ; Christ
is the Mediator, by whom we offer ourselves and all that we
have to the Father. He is our High Priest, who, having entered
iuto the celestial sanctuary, opens the way of access sor us.
He is our altar, upon which we place our oblatione, that what·
ever we venture to do, we may attempt in him. ln a word, it

'is he that “ hath made us kings and priests unto God.'' (b)

XVIII. What tamaius, then, but sor the blind to see, the
deas to hear, and even children to understand, this abomination
of the mass? which, being presented in a vessel of gold, has so
inebriated and stupefied all the kings and people os the earth,
from the highest to the lowest, that, more senseless thau the
brutes themselves, they have placed the whole of their salvation
in this fatal guls. Surely Satan never employed a more power·
ful engine to assail and conquer the kingdom of Christ. This is
the Helen, for which the enemies of the truth in the present
day contend with cruelty, rage, and lury3 a Helen, indeed,
with which they so pollute themselves with spiritual fornica·
tion, which is the most execrable of all. Here Ι touch not,
even with my little finger, the gross abusos which they might
pretend to be profanatione os the purity os their holy mass ; what
a scandalous traffic they carry on, what sordid gaius they make
by their masses, with what cnormous rapacity they gratisy their
avarica. 1 only point out, and that in few and plain wordS, the
