meditatione, or asa testimony of our humiliation in the pre·
sence of God, when we are desimus of confessing our guilt
before him. The first is not often contemplated in public
fasting, because all men have not the same constitution or health
of body; therefore it is rather more applicable to private fasting.
The second end is common to both, such preparation for prayer
being necessary to the whole Church, as well as to every one of
the faithful iu particular. The same may be said of the third.
For it will sometimes happen that God will afflict a whole nation
· with war, pestilence, or some other calamity; under such a
common scourge, it behoves all the people to maire a confession
of their guilt. When the hand of the Lord chastises an indi-
vidual, he ought to make a similar confession, either alone or
with his family. It is true that this acknowledgment lies prin·
cipally in the disposition of the heart; but when the beart is af·
. fected as it ought to be, it can scarcely avoid breaking out into
the extemal expression, and most especially when it promotes the
general edificati0n3 in order that all, by a public confessiones
their sin, may unitedly aclrnowledge the justice of God, and
may mutually animate each other by the influence of example.

XVI. Wherefore fasting, as it is a sign of humiliation, is
of more frequent use in public, than among individuals iu
private; though it is common to both, as we have already
observed. With regard to the discipline, therefore, of which
we are now treating, whenever supplications are to be presented
to God on any important occasion, it would be right to enjoin
the union of fasting with prayer. Thus when the believers
at Antioch “laid their hands on Paul and Bnmabas,” the
better to recommend their very important ministry to God,
tbey “insted’' as well aa “prayed''(s) So also when Paul
and Barnabas afterwards “ ordained elders in every Churcb,'’
they used to “ pray with fasting.'' (t) ln this lrind of fasting,
their only object was, that they might be more lively and un·
embarrassed in prayer. And we find by experieuce, thataftera
full meal, the mind does not aspire towards God so as to be able
to enter on prayer, and to continue in it with seriousness and
ardour of affection. So we are to understand what Luke says
of Anna, that she ‘¹ served God with fastings and prayers.'’ (rr)
For he does not place the worship of God in fasting, but
siguifies that by such means that holy woman habitunted her-
self to a constancy in prayer. Such was the fasting of Nehe·
miah, when he prayed to God with more than common fervour
for the deliverance of his people.(v) For this cause Paul
declares it to be expedient for believers to practise a temporary
