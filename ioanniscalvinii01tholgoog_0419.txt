with tears.” (c) For the doctrine then obtains its full authority,
and produces its due effect, when the minister not only declares
to all the people together what is their duty to Christ, but has
the right and means of enforcing it upon thom whom ha
observes to be inattentive, or not obedient to the doctrine.
11 any one either obstinately reject such admonitions, or mani·
fest his contempt 01 them by persisting in his miscouduct;
after he shall have been admonished a second time iu tha
presence 01 witnesses, Christ direets him to be summoned
before the tribunal of the Church, that is, the assembly of the
elders, and there to be more severely admonished by the public
authority, that if he reverence the Church, he may submit and
obey; but if this do not overcome him, and he still persovere in
his iniquity, our Lord then commauds him, as a despiser of the
Church, to be excluded from the society of believers. (d)

111. But as Jesus Christ in this passage is speaking only of
private faults‚ it is necessary to make this distinction—that
some sins are private, and others public or notorious. With
respect to the former, Christ says to every private individual,
“Tell him his fault between thee and him alone.'' (e) With
respect to those which are notorious, Paul says to Timothy,
“'I'hem that sin rebuke before all, that others also may
fear.’'(s) For Christ has before said, “ If thy brother shall
trespass against thee ;” which no person who is not coutentious
can understand in any other sense, than if our Lord had said,
“If any one sin against thoe, and thou alone know it, with·
out any other persons being acquainted with it.'’ But the
directiou given by the apostle to Timothy, to rebuke publicly
those whose transgressions were public, he himself exemplified
in his conduct to Peter. For when Peter committed a public
offence, he did not admonish him iu private, bnt brought him
forward before all the Church. (g) 'I'he legitimate course, then,
will be,—in correcting secret faults, to adopt the different
steps directed by Christ; and in the case 01 those which are
notorious, to proceed at oneo to the solemn correction 01 the
Church, especially if they be attended with public offence.

IV. It is also necessary to make another distinction between
different sins; some are smaller delinquenoies, others are flagi·
tious or enormous crimes. For the correction of atrocioris
crimes, it is not sufficient to employ admonition or reproof ;
recourse must be had to a severer remedy; as Paul shows,
when he does not content himself with censuring the incestu·
ous Corinthian, but pronounces sentence of excommunication
immediately on being certified of hia crime. Now, then, we
begin to have aclearer perception how the spiritual jurisdiction
