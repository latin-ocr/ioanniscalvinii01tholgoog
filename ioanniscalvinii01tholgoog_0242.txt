where our Lord requires the exercise ol mercy, they entirely
neglect it, aud indulge themselves in immoderate severity.
Supposing it impossible sor the Church to exist, where there is
not a perfect purity and integrity os lise, through a hatred os
crimes they depart from the true Church, while they imagine

themselves to be only withdrawing from the sections of tha
wicked. They allega, that the Church os Christ is holy. ⁸
But that they may also understand, that it ia composed of good
and bad rnen mingled together, let them hear that parable from
the lips os Christ, where it is compared to a net, in which
fishes of all kinds are collected, and no separationis made till
they are exposed on the shore. (w) Let them hear another
parable, comparing the Church to a field, which, aster having
been sown with good seed, is, by the craft os an enemy, cor·
rupted with tates, from which it is naver cleared till the har·

severest anathema? He not only does none ol these things,
but, on the contrary, acknowladges and speaks of them as a
Charch os Christ and a society os saints. lt there remained a
church among the Corinthiam, where sententious, factione,
