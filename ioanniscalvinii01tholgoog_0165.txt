though Christ introduces himself in his mediatorial capacity,
yet he claims to himself the right of election, in common with
the Father. “I speak not of all,” he says3 “l know whom l
have chosen.”(b) lf it be inquired whence he chose them,
he elsewhere answers, “out of the world,” (c) which he ex·
cludes from his prayers, when he commende his disciples to the
Father. It must be admitted, that when Christ asserta his
knowledge of whom hc has chosen, it refers to a particular
class of mankind, and that they are distinguished, not by the
nature of their virtues, but by the decree of Heaven. Whence
it follows, that none attain any excellence by their own ability
or industry, since Christ represents himself as the author of
election. His enumeration of Judas among the elect, though
he was a devil, only refers to the apostolical office, which,
though an illustrious instance of the Divine favour, as Paul so
frequently acknowledges in his own person, yet does not in·
clude the hope of eternal salvation. Judas, therefore, in his
unfaithful exercise of the apostleship, might he worse thena

he will never suffer one to perish; for in securing their salva·
tion, he will perform what be has promised, by exerting the
power of God, who is greater than all. What he says in
‘another place, “ Those that thou gavest me Ihave kept, and
none of them is lost, but the son of perdition,'’ is a mode of
expression, called catachresis, but the sense issufficiently plain.
'Phe conclusion is, that God creates whom he chooses to be
his children by gratuitous adoption3 that the cause of this is
wholly in himself 3 because he exclusively regards his own
secret determination.

’ Vlll. But, it will be said, Ambrose, Origen, and Jerome
believed that God dispenses his grace among men, according to
his foreknowlcdge of the good use which every individual will
make of it. Augustine also was once of the same sentiment ς
but when he had made a greater proficiency in scriptural know·
ledge, he not only retracted, but powerfully confuted it. And
after his retractation, rebuking the Pelagians for persisting in
this error, he says, “ Who but must wonder that this most
ingenious sense should escape the apostlei For after propo-
sing what was calculated to excite astonishment respecting
those children yet unborn, he started to himself, by way of
objection, the following question: What, then, is there unright-
eousness with God? lt was the place for him to answer, that
God forcsaw the merita of each of them; yet he says nothing
of this, but resorts to the decrees and mercy of God.” And in
another place, after having discarded all merita antecedent ιο
