residcd in the assembly of the elders, which was in the Church
what a senate is in a city. Cyprian, when he mentions by
whom it was exercised in his time, generally unites all the
clergy with the bishop; but in other passages he also shows, that
the clergy presided in such a manner, that the people were not
excluded from this cognizancc. For he expresses himself iu
these words: “From the commencement of my episcopate,l
have deterrnined to do nothing without the counsel of the clergy
and the consent of the people.” But the common and usual
custom was sor the jurisdiction of the Church to be exercised
by the council of the presbyters ; of whom, as l have observed,
there were two classes, for some were ordained to the office of ·
teaching, others were only censors of manners. This institu-
tion gradually degenerated from its original establishment; so
that, in the tirne of Ambrose, the judicial administration of the
Church was wholly in the hands of the clergy3 of which he
complains in the following language: “ The ancient synagogue,
and afterwards the Church, had elders, without whose advice
nothing was done. 1 know not by what negligence this practice
has been discontinued, except from the indolence of the doctors,
or rather from their pride, while they wish none but themselves,
to be seen.” We perceive how indignant was that holy man,
that there had been some declension from a better state of things,
though they still retained an order that was at least tolerable.
What would he say now, if he were to see the present deformed
ruins, which exhibit scarcely a vestige of the ancient edilice!
What a complaint would he make! First, in opposition to law
and justice, that which had been given to the Ohurch, the
bishop usurped entirely to himself. This resembles the conduct
of a consul or president, expelling the senate, and seizing the
sole administration of a government. But as the bishop is
superior to other persons in honour, so the assembly or congre-
gation possesses more authority than one individual. It wasa
gross outrage, therefore, for oue man to transfer to himself all
the power of the community, and thereby to open a door to
licentioris tyranny, to deprive the Church of its rights, and to
suppress and abolish an assembly appointed by the Spirit
·· of Christ.

Vll. But usone evil always produces another, bishops, dis·
dainiug this charge as unworthy of their attention, have delega-
ted it to others. Hence the creation of officials, to discharge
that duty. I say nothing, at present, of the characters of the
persons ; l only assert, that they differ in no respect from civil
judges; yet they still call it a spiritual jurisdiction, where all
the contentiori is about secular affairs. Though there were no
other evil, what effrontery must they have, to call a court full

of litigation the jugilcature of the Ohurchl Βηῃς,
