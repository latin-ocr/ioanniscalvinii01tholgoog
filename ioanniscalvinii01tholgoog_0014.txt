his mercy he saved us; that being justified by his grace, we
should be made heirs 61 eternal life.”(m) By this confession
we divest man 61 611 righteousness, even to the smallest particle,
till through mere mercy he has been regenerated to the hope of
eternal tise; for if a righteousness of works contributed any
thing to our justificati0n‚ we are not truly said to be “justified
by grace.” 'Phe apostle, when he asserted justification to be
by grace, had certainly not forgotten his argument in another

place, that “if it be of works, then it is no more grace.”(n) ·

And what else does our Lord intend, when he declares, “l am
not come to call the righteous, but 61666161 ” (o) If sinuers
only are admitted, why do we seek to enter by a counterfeit
righteousness?

vl. 'Phe same thought frequently recurs to 166, that 1661 16
danger of injuring the mercy of God, by labouring with so
much anxiety in the defence of this doctrine, as though it were
doubtful 61 obscure. But such being our malignity, that, unless
it be most powerfully subdued, it never allows to God that
which belongs to him, I arn constrained to dwell a little longer
upon it. But as the Scriptura is sufficiently perspicuous on
this subject, Ι shall use its language in preference to my own.
Isaiah, aster having described the universal ruin 61 mankind,
properly subjoins the method of recovery. “ 'l'he Lord saw it,
and it displeased him that there was no judgment. hudhe saw
that there was 66 1666, and wondered that there was no interces-
sor: therefore his own ann brought salvation 11616 him ; and his
righteousness it sustained him.” (p) Where are our righteous·
nesses, if it be true, as the prophet says, that no one assists the
Lord in procuring his salvation? So another prophet introduces
the Lord speaking of the reconciliationes 6166616 16 himself, say·
ing, “ 1 will betroth thee unto me for ever, in righteousness, and
in judgment, and in leving-kindness, and in mereies. l will
have merey upon her that had not obtained mercy.'' (q) If this
eovenant, which is evidently our first union with God, depend
66 his merey, there remains no foundation for our righteousness.
And l should really wish to be informed by those, who pretend
that man advanecs to meet God with some righteousness of
works, whether there be any righteousness at all, but that which
is accepted by God. 11 11 be madness to entertain such a thought,
what that is acceptable to God ean proeeed 11616 his enemies,
who, with all their actions, arethe objeets 61 his complete
abhorrenee? And that we are all the inveterate and avowed
enemies of our God, till we are justified and received into his
friendship, is an undeniable truth. (r) If justification be the
