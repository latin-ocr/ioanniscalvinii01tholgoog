VII. Equally monstrous is the error of those who imagine
that souls will not resume the bodies which at present belong to
them, but will be lurnished with others altogether different. It
was the very futile reasoning of the Manichaeans, that it is absurd
to expect that the flesh which is so impure will ever rise again.
As if there were no impurity attached to the souls, which they
nevertheless encouraged to entertain hopes of a heavenly life.
It was therefore just as if they had maintained, that any thing
infected with the contagion of sin is incapable of being purified
by the power of God; for that reverie, that the flesh was cre·
atad hythe devil, and therefore naturally imptlre, l at present
sorbeat to notice ; and only observa, that whatever we have in
us now unworthy of heaven, will not hinder the resurrection.
In the first place, when Paul exhorta believers to “alsense’'
themselves “from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit,'’(lt)
thence follows the judgment he elsewhere denounces, “thet
every one ” shall “receive the things done in his body, accord·
ing to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad ; '³ (i) with
which agrees another passage, “that the life also of lesus
might be made manifest in our body.” (lr) Wherefore in an·
other place, he prays to God that the whole person rnay “be
preserved blameless unto the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ,'’
even the “hody‚'’ as well as the “soul and spirit.²’ (l) And no
wonder; for that those bodies which God has dedicated as
temples for himself, should sinlr into corruption, without any
hope of resurrection, would he absurd in the extreme. What
is to be concluded from their being members of christion)
from God's enjoining every part of them to be sanotihed to
himself, requiring their tongues to celebrate his name, their
hands to be lifted up with purity to him, (a) aad their bodies
altogether to be presented to him as “living sacrifices? ’' (o)
This part of our nature therefore being dignified with such illua·
trious honour by the heavenly Judge‚ what madness is betrayed
by a mortal man, in asserting it to be reduced to ashes without
any hope of restoration! And Paul, when ho gives us this
exhortation, “Glorify God in your body, and in your spirit,
which are God's,” (p) certainly does not countenanoe consigu-
ing to eternal corruption that which he asserta to bc consecrated
to God. Nor is there any point more clearly established in
Scriptura, than the resurrectiones our present bodies. “ This
corruptible,'' says Paul, “must put on incorruptior, and this
mortal must put on immortality.'' (q) If new bodies were to
be formed by God, what would become of this change of
quality? If it had been said, that we must he renewed‚ the
