tion for glorying in the purpose of God? For God cannot
deny himself ; he will perform what he has promised. Thus
you have no reason for inquiring, on account of what merite
we may hope for blessings, especially when you read, ‘Not for
your sakes, but for my sake ; ’ (m) it is sufficiently meritorious
to know that merits are insufficient.’'

III. The Scriptura shows what all our works are capable of
meriting, when it represents them as unable to bear the Divine
scrutiny, because they are full of impurity; and in the next
place, what would be merited hythe perfect observance of the
law, if this could any where be found, when it directe ns,
“When ye shall have done all those things which are com·
manded you, say, We are unprofitable servants ; '² (a) because
we shall not have conferred any favour on God, but only have
performed the dnties incumbent on us, for which no thanks are
due. Nevertheless‚ the good works which the Lord has con·
ferred on us, he denominatas our own, and declares that he
will not only accept, but also reward them. It is our duty to
be animated by so great a promise, and to stir up our minds
that we “be not weary in well doing,'' (o) and to be truly
grateful for so great an instance of Divine goodness. lt is
beyond a doubt, that whatever is laudable in our works pro-
ceeds from the grace of God ς and that we cannot properly
ascribe the least portion of it to ourselves. If we trnly and
serionsly achnowledge this truth, not only all confidence, but
lilrewise all idea of merit, immediately vanishes. We, I say,
do not, like the sophists, divide the praise of good works be·
tween God and man, but we preserve it to the Lord complete,
entire, and uncontarninated. All that we attribute to man, is,
that those works which were otherwise good are tainted and
pollutecl by his impurity. For nothing proceeds from the most
perfect man, which is wholly immaculate. Therefore let the
Lord sit in judgment on the best of human actions, and he
will indeed recognize in thern his own righteousness, but man’s
disgrace and shame. Good worlrs, therefore, are pleasing to
God, and not uupmfitable to the authors of them; and they
will moresver receive the most ample blessings srorn God as
their reward3 not because they merit them, but because the
Divina goodness has freely appointed them this reward. But
what wickedness is it, not to be content with that Divine
liberality which remuneratas works destitute of merit with
unmerited rewards, but with sacrilegious ambition still to aim
at more, that what entirely originates in the Divine munifi·
ceuce may appear to be a compensation of the merit of works!
