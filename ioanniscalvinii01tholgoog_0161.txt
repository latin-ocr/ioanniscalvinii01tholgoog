ther under tha example of Jacob and Esau3 for being both child·
ren of Abraham, and both enclosed in their mother’s womb, the
transfer of the honour of primogenitura to Jacob was by a pre·
tamatural change, which Paul, however, contenda indicated the
election of the one and the reprobation os the other. The ori·
gin and the nauseare inquired, which the champions of fore-
knowledge maintain tobeexhibited in the virtues and the vices of
men. For this is their short and easy doctrina - 'rna God has
shewed in the person of Jacob, that he clects such as are worthy
of. his grace; and in the person of Esau, that ha rejects those
whom he foresees to bc unworthy. This, indeed, they assert
with confidence3 but what is the testimony of Paul l “ The
children being not yet born, neither having done any good or
evil, that the purpose of God according to election might stand,
not of works, but ef him that calleth, it was said, 'Phe elder
shall serve the younger; as it is written, Jacob have 1 loved,
bnt Esau have Ihated.'' (p) lf this distinction between the
brothers was influenced by foreknowledge, the mention of the
time must certainly be unnecessary. On the supposition that
Jacob was elected, because that honour was acquired by his
future virtues, ιο what purpose could Paul remark that he was
not yet born? lt would not have been so proper to add, that
he had not yet done any good, for it will be immediately
replied, that nothing is concealcd from God, and therefore the
piety of Jacob must have been present before nim. If grace be
the reward of worlrs, they ought to have had their just value
attributed to them before Jacob was born, as much as if ha
were already grown to maturity. But the apostla proceeds in
unravelling the difficulty, and teaches that the adoption of Ja-
cob flowed not from works, bnt from the calling of God. ln
speaking of works, he introduces no time, future or past, but
positivcly opposea them to the calling of God, intending the
establishment of the one, and the absolute subversiones the
othcr; as though he had said, We must consider the good plea-
snre of God, and not the productioris cf men. Lastly, the very
terma, electiora and purpose, certainly exclude from this subject
all the causes frequently invented by men, independently of
God’s secret counsel.

V. Now, what pretexts will be urged to obscure these argu·
ments, by those who attribute ιο works, either past or future,
any influence on electiont For this is nothing but an evasion
of the apostle's argument, that the distinction between the two
brothers depends not on any consideration of works, but on the
mera calling of God, because it was fixcd between them when
they were not yet born. Nor would their subtilty have es
