nation or languege3 whereas the Greek word αιολουῢκ, aeota

justly incur ridicule myself, is Ι were to dwell on a serious
refutation os such things, they are so frivotous and ludicrous.
XXIV. To prevent them, however, from continuing their
impositione on silly women, it is necessary, as we proceed, to
exposa their vanity. They create with great pomp aud
solemnity their readers, psalmists, beadles‚ acolothists, to dis·
charge those offices in which they employ either boyS, or at
least those whom they call laymen. For who, in most cases,
lights the wax tapers, who pours wine and water out os the
flagon, buta boy, or some mean layman, who gets his livelihood
by it? Do not the same persons chant? Do they not open
and shut the doors ot‘ the churchesl For who ever saw in their
temples an acolothist or beadle performing his office? On
the contrary, he who, when aboy, discharged the duty of an
acolothist, as soon as he is admitted into that order, cesses to
ba what he begins to be called ; sothat it should seem to ba
their deliberate intention to discard the office when they as·
sume the title. We see what need they have to be consecrated
by sacramenta, and to receive the Holy Spirit; it is, that they
may do nothing. 1t they allege, that this arises from the
perverseness of the present age, that men desert and neglect
their official duties, let them at the same time consess, that
their holy orders, which they so wonderfully extol, are os no
use or benefit to the Ohurch in the present day, and that their
whole (lhurch is filled witha curse, since it permits boys and
laymen to handle the tapers aud flagons, which none are wor-
thy of touching except those who have been consecrated as
acolothists; end since it leaves boys to chant those services,
which ought never to be heard but from a consecrated mouth.
But sor what purpose do they consecrate their exorcista? Ι
know that the Jews had their ‘exorcists3 but Ι find that they
derived their name from the exorcisma which they practised.
Respecting these counterseit exorcists, who ever heard of their
exhibiting one specimen of their profession? It ispretended
that they are invested with power to lay hands upon maniacs,
demoniaca and catechumens; but they cannot persuade the
damona that they are endued with such power, not only
because the demous do not submit to their commanda, but be-
cause they even exercise dominion over them. For scarcely
one in ten can be found among them who is not influenced
by au evil spirit. Whatever ridiculous pratensious they may
set up respecting their contemptible orders, are the mere
compositione os ignorauce and salsehood. Oi the ancient
acolothists, beadles‚ and readers, we have spoken already, when
we discussed the order oi the Ohurch. Our present design is
