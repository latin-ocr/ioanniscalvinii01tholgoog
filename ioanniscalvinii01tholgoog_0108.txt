Christ is appointed as the one Mediator, by whose intercession
the Father is rendered propitious aud favourable to us. The
saints have likewise their intercessions, in which they mutually
commend each other’s interests to God, arrd which are mon·
tioned by the apostle ; (l) but these are so far from detracting
any thing from the intercession of Christ, that they are entire·
ly dependent on it. For as they arise from the affection of
love, reciprocally felt by us towards each other as members of
ono body, so lilrewise they are referred to the unity of tha
Head. Being made also in the name of Christ, 'what are they
but a declaration, that no man can be benefitod by any prayers
at all, independently of Christ’s intercessioni And as tho in·
tarcession of Christ is no objection to our mutually pleadirrg
for each other, in our prayers in the Church, so let it be corr·
sidered as a certain maxim, that all the intercessions of the
whole Church should be directed to that principm ono. We
ought to boware of ingratitudo particularly on this head, be·
cause God, pardoniug our unworthiuess, not only permits us
to pray each one for himself, but even admits us as intercessors
for one another. For, when those who richly deservo to be
rejected, if they should privately pray each for himself, are ap-
pointed by God as advocates of his Church, what pride would
it betray to abusa this liberality to obscuro the honour of
Christ!

XX. Now, the cavil of the sophists is quite frivolous, that
Christ is the Mediator of redemption, but believers os interces-
sion; as if Christ, aster performing a temporary mediation, had
left to his servants that which is eternal and shall never die.
They who detract so diminutive a portion of honour from him,
treet him, doubtless, very favourably. But the Scriptura, with
the simplicity of which a pious man, forsalring these impostore,
ought to be contented, speaks very differently3 for when John
says, “ If any man sin, we have an Advocato with tho Father,
Jesus Christ‚’' (m) does he only mean that he hasbeen here·
tofore an Advocato for us, or does he not rather ascribe to him
a perpetual intercession? What is intended by the assertion
of Paul, that he “ is even at the right hand os God, and also
maketh intercession for usi '’ (rt) And when he elsewhere
calls him the “ ono Mediator between God and man‚” does he
not refer to prayers, which he has mentioned just before ? '² (o)
For having first asserted that intercessione should be made for
all men, he immediately adds, in confirmation of that idea,
that all have one God and one Mediator. Consistent with
which is the explanation of Augustine, when he thus expresses
