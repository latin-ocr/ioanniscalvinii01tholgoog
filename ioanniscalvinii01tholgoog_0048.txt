quish all controversy respectiug the word. Nor do we deny
that the Divine law contains perfect righteousness. For al·
though, being under an obligation to fulfil all its precepts, we
should, even after a perfect obedience to it, only be unprofitable
servants, -yet, siuce the Lord has honoured the observance of
it with the title of rfgbteousness, we would not detract from
what he has given. We freely acknowledge, therefore, that
the perfect obedienoe of the law is righteousness, and that the
observance of every particular command is a part of righteous·
ness; since complete righteousness consists of all the parts
But we deny that such a kind of righteousness any where ex·
ists. And therefore we reject the righteousness of the law;
not that it is of itself defective and mutilated, but because, ou
account of the debility of our fiesh, (a) it is no where to be
found. It may be said, that the Scriptura not only calls the
Divina precepts righteousnessea but gives this appellation also to
the works of the saiuts. As where it relates of Zacharias and
his wife, that “ they were both righteous before (lod, walking in
all his commandments: ’' (y) certainly, when it speaks thus, it
estimates their works rather according to the nature of the law,
than according to the actual condition of the persons. Here itis
necessary to repeat the observation which I have just made,
that no rule is to be drawn from the incautiousness of the
Greek translator. But as Luke has not thought proper to alter
the common version, neither will leontend for it. Those
things which arecommanded in the lav, God has enjoined
tttltttltttt‘lt‘iltutus dimittunt
broken by every act of transgression. Since the lirw, there·
fore, only prescribes a righteousness, if we contemplate the
law itself, all its distinct commands are parts of righteousness3
if we consider men, by whom they are performed, they cannot
obtain the praise of rIghteousness frorn one act, while they are
transgressors in many, and while that sarno act is partly vicious
by reason of its imperfectiori.

VIII. ButI proceed to the second class of texts, in which
the principal difficulty lies. Paul urges nothing more forcible
iu proof of justification by faith, than what is stated respecting
Abraham—that he “believed God, audit was counted unto
hiur for righteousness.” (z) Since the action of Phinehas,
therefore,is said to have been “counted unto him for right·
eousness’' (a) wc may also use the same argument concerning
works, thch Paul insists on respecting faith. Therefore our
adversaries, aa though they had established the point, determine
