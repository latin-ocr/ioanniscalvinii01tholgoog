XLIV. Next follows the second partos the prayer, in which
we descend to our own interests; not that we must dismiss all
thoughts of the Divino glory, (which, according to Paul, (o)
should be regarded even in eating and drinking) and only seek
what is advantageous to ourselves; but we have already an·
nonnced that thiais the distinction-that God, by exclu-
sively claiming three petitions, absorbs us entirely in the con·
sideration of himself, that thus he may prove our piety; after·
wards he permits us to attend to our own interests, yet on this
condition, that the end of all our requests be the illustration of
his glory, by whatever benefits be confers on us, since nothing
ismore reasonable than that we live and die to him. But the
first petition of the second part, Grva· ns aare oar ona nuar
aaran, is a general request to God for a supply of all our corpo-
real wants in the present state, not only for food and clothing‚
bnt also for every thing which he sees to be conducive to
our good, that we may eat our broad in peace. By this we
briefly surrender ourselves to his care, and commit ourselves to
his providence‚ that he may feed, nourish‚ and preserve ns.
For our most benevolent Father disdains not to receive even
our body into his charge and protection, that he may exercise
our saith in these minute circumstances, while we‘expect every
thing from him, even down to a crumb of bread arrd a drop of
water. For since it is a strange effect of our iniquity, to be
affected and distressed with greater solicitude for the body than
for the soul, many, who venture to confidete God the interests of
their souls, are nevenheless still solicitous concerning the body,
still anxious what they shall eat and what they shall wear; and
unless they have an abundance of coru, wine, and oil, for tbe
supply os their future wants‚ tremble with fear. Os so much
greater importance to us is the shadow of this transitory life,
than that eternal immortality. But they who, confiding in
God, have once cast ofl that anxiety for the concerns of the
body, expect likewise to receive frorn hirn' superior blessings,
even salvation and eternal life. lt is therefore no trivial exer-
cise of faitb, to expect from God those things which otherwise
fill us withso much anxiety; nor is it a small proficiency when
we have divested ourselves ot⁴ this infidelity, which is almost
universally interwoven with the human constitution. The
speculatione of some, concerning supernatural bread, appear tn
