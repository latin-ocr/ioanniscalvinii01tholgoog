dom will then preveil in the world, when all shall submit to
his will. Now, we speak not here of his secret will, by which
he governs all things, end appoints them to fulfil his own pur·
poses. For though Satan and men oppose him with all the
violence of rege, yet his incomprehensible wisdom is able, not
only vto divert their impetue'sity‚ but to overrule it for the
accomplishment ot⁴ his decrees. But the Divina will here in-
tended, is that to which voluntary obedience corresponds; and
therefore heaven is expressly compared with the earth, because
the angele, as the Psalmist says, spontaneously “do his com·
mandments, heerkening unto the voice of his word.'' (rt) We
are therefore commended to desire that, es in heaven nothing is
done but according t0 the Divine will, and the angels are
placidly conformed ιο every thing that is right, so the earth,
all obstinacy and depravity being annihilated, may be subject
to the same government. And in praying for this, we renounce
our own carnal desires; because, unless we resign all our affec·
tions to God, we are guilty of all the opposition iu our power
to his will, for nothing proceeds from us but what is sinsul.
And we are likewise habitueted by this petition ιο a renuncia·
tion of oursclves, thet God may rule us according ιο his own
pleasure3 and not only so, but that he may also create in us
new minds and new hearts, annihilating our own, that we may
experience no emotion ef desire within us, but a mere consent
to his will; iu a word, thet we may have ne will of eur
own, but that our hearts may be governed by his Spirit, by
whose interne] teachings we may leam to love those things
which plesse him, and to hate those which he disapproves3
consequently, that he may render abortire all those desires
which are repugnant ιο his will. These arethe three first
clauses of this prayer, in praying which we ought solely to
have in view the glory of God, omitting all considerationes
ourselvcs, and not regarding any advantage of our own, which,
though they largely contributa to it, should not be eur end in
these petitione. But though all these things, even if we never
think of them, nor wish for them, nor request them, must
nevertheless happen in their appointed time, yet they ought to
be the objects of our wishes, and the subjecte of our prayers.
And such petitione it will be highly proper sor us to offer, that
we may testify and profess ourselves ιο be the servants and
sons of God3 manifesting the sincercst devotedness, and mak-
ing the most zealous efforts in our power for edvancing the
honour which is due ιο him, both as a Master and as a Father.
Persons, therefore, who are not incited, by this ardent zeal for
premoting the glory of God, to prey, that his name may be
