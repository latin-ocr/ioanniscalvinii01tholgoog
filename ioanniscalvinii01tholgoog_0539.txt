that the apostle intended to express a peculias advantage arising
from saith, of which the residence of Christ in the hearts of
believers is one of the effecta. lu the same manner, when the
Lord called himself “ tho bread of life,’' (t) he intended not
only to teach that salvation is laid up for us in the saith of his
death and resurrection, but also that, by our real participation of
him, his life is transferred to us, and becomes ours 3 just as breed,
when it is taken sor food, communicatos vigour to the body.

Vl. When Angustiae, whom they bring forward as their
advocate, said that we eat the body of Christ by believing in
him, it was with no other meaning than to show that this
eating is not of a corporeal nature, but solely by faith. This
1 admit; but at the same time 1 add, that we embrace Christ
by saith, not as appearing at a distance, but as uniting himself
with us, to become our head, and to make us his members.
1 do not altogether disapprove, however, such a mode of ex·
pression, but if they mean to detine what it is to eat the fleshof
Christ, Ι deny this to be a complete explanation. Otherwise,
1 sce that Augustine has frequently used this phrase; aa when
he says, “ Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, ye have
no life in you ; (i) this is a figure which enjoins a participation
of the sufferings of our Lord, and a sweet and useful recollection
in the memory, that his flesh was wounded and crucified for us: ''
and again, when he says, “ That the three thousand, who were
converted by the preaching of Peter, (kldrank the blood of Christ
by believing in him, which they bad shed in persecuting him.’'
But in many other passages he highly celebrates that beneficial
consequence of faith, and states our souls to be aa much refresh·
ed by the communion of the body of Christ, as our bodies are
bytho bread which we eat. And the very same idea is con·
veyed by Chrysostom, when he says, “ 'Phat Christ makes us
his body, not only by faith, but also in reality.'’ For he does
not mean that this benefit is obtained any otherwise thau by
faith3 he only intends to precludc a supposition from being
entertained by any one, that this faith is nothing more than a
speculative apprehension. 1 say nothing at present of those
who maintain the Lord’s supper to be a mere mark of external
profession, because 1 think Ι have sufficiently refuted their
error, when treating of the sacramenta iu general. Only let it
be observed, that when Christ says, “This cup is the new
testanrent, or covenant, in my blood,'’ (l) this is the expression
of a promise calculated for the confirmationes saith, whence
it follows, that unless we direct our views to God, and embrace
what he offers us, we never properly celebrate tho sacred supper.

Vll. Nor am 1 satisfied with those persons, who, after having
acknowledged that we have some communion with Christ,
