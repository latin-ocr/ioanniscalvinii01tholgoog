application of it to any individual they chose, or rather to every
oue who was willing to purchase such a commodity with ready
money. 'I'hough they could not reach the price of Judas, yet,
10 exemplify some characteristic of their author, they have re·

taiued the resemblance of number. Judas sold Jesus 101 thirty r

pieces of silver; these men, as far as in them lies, sall him, in ·

French money, for thirty pieces of copper; Judas sold him but ,

once; they sell him as often as they meet with a purchaser. ²

ln this sense, we deny that they are priests3 that they can
intercede with God on behalf 01 the people by such an oblati0n;
that they can appense the wrath of God, or obtain the remissiora
01 sins. For Christ is the sole Priest and High-Priest of the
New Testament, to whom all the ancient priesthoods have
been transferred, and in whom they are all terminated and
closed. And even 11 the Scriptura had made no mention 01
the eternal priesthood of Christ, yet as God, since the abroga-
tion 01 the former priesthoods, has instituted no other, the
argument of the apostle is irrefragable, that “no man taketh
this honour nuto himself, but he that is called of God.”(p)
With what effrontery, then, do these sacrilegious mortais, who
boast 01 being the executioners of Christ, dare to call them·
selvas priests of the living God!

XV. There is a beautiful passage in Plato, in which he
treats of the ancient expiatione among the heathen, and ridi·
cules the foolish confidence 01 wicked and profligate men, who
thought that such disguises would conceal their crimes from
the view 01 their gods, and, as if they had made a compromise
with their gods, indulged themselves in their vices with the
greater Ι11111111. This passage almost seems as if it had been
written with a view to the missal expiation as it is now
practised in the world. To defraud and circumvent another
person, every one knows to be unlawful. To injure widows,
to plunder orphans, to harass the poor, to obtain the property
01 others by wicked arts, to seiza any one’s fortune by perjuries
and frauds, to oppress a neighbour with violence and tyrannical
terror, are universally acknowledged to be enormons crimes.
How, then, do so many persons dare to commit all these sins, as
if they might perpetrate them with impunity? If we duly
consider, we shall find that they derive fresh encoruagement
from no other cause than the confidence which they feel that
they shall be able to satisfy God by the sacrifice of the mass,
as a complete discharge of all their obligations to him, orat
least that it affords theman easy mode of compromising with
him. Plato afterwards goes on to ridicule the gross stupidity

of those who expect by such expiations to be delivered from ἱ
