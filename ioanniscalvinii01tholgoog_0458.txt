years old; and especially when he directs that the choica shall
be limited to those who have been content with one marriage,
and have thus already given proof of their continence. And
we condemn the vow os celibacy for no other reason, but
because it is unjustly considered as a service acceptable to
God, and is rashly made by those who have not the power to
kee it.

2ng But how was it possible to apply this passage os Paul
to nuns? For widows were appointed deaconesses, not to
charm God by songs or unintelligible murmurs, and to spend
the rest os their time in idleness3 but to serve the poor on
behals os the whole Ohurch, aud to employ themselves with
all attention, eamestness, aud diligencie, iu the duties of charity.
They made a vow os widowhood, not with a view of perform-
ing any service to God in abstaining from marriage, but merely
that they might be more at liberty sor the discharge of their ¹
office. Lastly‚ they made this vow, not in their youth, nor in

intolerable that unhappy girls, before they are old enough to
be capable of knowing or having any experience of themselves,
should be inveigled by fraud and compelled by threats to en·
tangle themselves in those execrable suares. Ishall not stay
to oppose the other two vows, made by monks and nuns, of
poverty and obedience. l will only observe, that beside the
many superstitious with which, under existing circumstances,
they are interwoven, they appear to be framed for the purpose
os mocking both God and men. But that we may not seem
too severe in agitating every particular point, we shall content
ourselves with the general repetition already given.

XX. The nature of those vows which are legitimate and
acceptable to God, l think, has been sufficiently declared.
Yet as timid and inexperienced consciences, even aster they
are dissatisfied with a vow, and convinced ot' its impropriety,
nevertheless feel doubts respecting the obligation, and are griev-
