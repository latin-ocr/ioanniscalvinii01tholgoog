to become the liberator 01 1110 people by the power of the Lord,
“ he slew the Egyptian ; ” (i) and when he punished the idola-
try of the people by the slaughter of three thousand men in
0110 day. (11) The same motiva actuated David, when, 01 1110
close of his lise, he commanded his son Solomon to put to death
Joab and Shiinei. (l) Hence, also, it is enumerated among
the virtues of aking, to‘ ‘destroy all the wicked 01 1110 land,
that he may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the
Lord.’' (111) The same topic furnishes the eulogium given
to Solomon:‘ ‘Thou lowest righteousness, and hatest wicked-
0000. ”(11 11) How did the meek and placid disposition 01 Moses
burn with such cmelty, that, 01101 having his hands imbrued
10 1110 blood of his brethren, 110 continued to 30 through the
camp till three thousand were slainl How did David, who
discovered such humanity all his lifetime, in his last moments
bequeath such a cruel 1010001100 10 1110 0011 respecting Joab?
“ Let not his hoar head go down to the 31010 10 peace;’' and

Again: “ A king that sitteth in the throne of judgmeut, scat-

and there shall 00010 forth a vessel for the finer. Take away
the wicked 11010 before the king, and his throne shall be esta·
blished in righteousness.” (r) Again: ‘⁴ He that justifieth the
wicked, and he that condemneth the just, 0100 they both are
an abomination to the Lord.'' (s) Again: “ 110 evil man
seeketh only rebellion; therefore a cruel 1000000301 shall be
sent against him.’' (1) Again: “He that saith unto the
wicked, Thou art righteous3 him shall the people curse,
0011000 shall abhor him.”(a) Now, if it be true justice 101
