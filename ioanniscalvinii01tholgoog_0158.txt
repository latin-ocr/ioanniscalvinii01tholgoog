God’s various distribution of his favonrs according to the mea·
sure of his judgment. If they make a transition to persons
where the inequality ismore offensivo to them, the example

of Christ at least ought to detor thern from carelessly prating
concerning this sublimo mystery. A mortal man isconoeived
of the seed of David: to tho merit of what virtues will they
ascribe his being mede, even in the womb‚ the Head of angela,
the only begotten Son of God, tho Imago and Glory of the
Father, the Light, Righteousness, and salvation of the world?
lt is judiciously remarked by Augustino, that there is the
brightest example of gratuitous election in the Head of the
Church himself, that it may not perplex us in the mombers;
that he did not become the Son of God by leading arighteous
life, but was gratuitously invested with this high honour, that
ho might afterwards render others portakers of the gifts be·
stowed upon him. If any one inquire, why others aro not all
that he was, or why we are all at such a vast distance from
him,—why we are all corrupt, aud he purity itself, —ho will
betray both folly and impudonco. But if they persist in the
wish to deprivo God of the uncontrollable right of choosing
and rejecting, let them also take away what is given to Christ.
Now, it isos importance to attend to what the Scriptura de·
clares respecting every individual. Paul’s assertion, that we
were “ chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world,” (g)

certainly precludes any consideration of merit in us, for itis
as though ho had said, our heavenly Fathor, finding nothing

⁴ worthy of his choico in all the posterity of Adam, turned his

views towards his Christ, to choose members from his body
whom he would admit to the followship of life. Let be·
liovers, then, be satisfied with this reason, that we were adopted
in Christ to the heavenly inheritance‚ because in ourselves we
were incapablo of such high dignity. Η6 has a similar remark
in another place, where ho exhorts the Colossians to “ give
thanks unto the Father, who had made them meet to be parta·
kers of the inheritance of tho saints.'' (Ιι) If election precedes
this grace of God, which makes us meet to obtain the glory of
the life to como, what will God find in usto induce him to
elect ns? Another passage from this apostle will still more
clearly express my meaning. “He bath chosen us,” he says,
“before the foundation of tho world, according to the good
pleasuro of his will, that we should be holy, and without blame
before him ; ” (ι’) where he opposes tho good pleasure of God
to all our merits whatsoever.

11. To render tho proof more complete, it will be fulto
notice all the clauses of that passage, which, taken in “’ 66·
