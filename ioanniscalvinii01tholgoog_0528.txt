XXX. At length they object, that there is no more reason
why infants should be admitted to baptism than to the Lord’s
supper, which, however, is not administered to them. As
though the Scripturas did not make a considerable difference
between the two cases in every respect. Infaut communion
was practised, indeed, in the ancient Church, 33 appears from
Cyprian and Augustine ; but the custom has very properly been
discontinned. For if we consider the nature and property of
baptism, we find it to be an entrance or initiation into the
Chnrch, by which we are enrolled among the paople of God -
a sign of our spiritual regeneration, by which we are born again

in which, es far 33 1313133 13 baptism, the Lord makes no dis·

examination, which would in vain be expected from infants.
Again: “He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, cateth and
drinketh damnation to himself, not discerning 1113 Lord's
