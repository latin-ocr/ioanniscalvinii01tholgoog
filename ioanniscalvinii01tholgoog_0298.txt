VIII. NoW, let ns see how faithfnlly they exercise their office,
which is the second mark by which we are to judge of a legiti-
mate pastor. Of the priests whom they create, some are own-lca,
others are called senators. The former of these classes was
unknown to the ancient Church‚ and to hold sncha place in
the Church was so incompatible with the monastic profession,
that anciently, when any one was ehosen from a monastery to be
one of the clergy, he ceased to be a monh. And even Gregory,
in whose tIme there was much corruption, yet suffered not this
confusion to take place. For he enjoined, that they who be·
came abbots should be divested of their elerical character; for
that no one could be a monk and a clergyman at the same tIme,
because the one would be an impediment to the other. Now,
if I inquhe how that man can duly discharge his office, whom
the canons declare to be unfit for it, what answer will they
make? I suppose they will cite those abortiva dearces of Inno-
cent and Boniface, by which monks are admitted to the honour
and authority of the priesthood, so that they may still remain
in their monasteries. But what reason is there, that any illiterata
ass, as soon as he has once occupied the see of Rome, should
by one diminutive word overturn all the usages of antiquity?
Bnt of this we shall say more hereafter. Suffice it at present
to remark, that during the purer times of the Chnrch, it was
deemed a great absurdity for a monh to hold the office of a
priest. For Jerome denies that he performed the office of a
priest while he lived among the monhs3 bnt represents hImseIf
as one of the people who ought to be governed by the priests.
But if we grant them this point, how do they executa their
office? There are some of the mendicants, and a few of the
otherS, who preach. All the rest of the monhs either chant or
mutter over messes in their cloisters, as if it were the design
of Iesus Christ that presbyters should be appointed for this
purpose, or as if the nature of their office admitted of it. While
the Scriptura clearly testifies that it is the duty of a presbyter
to govern his own Ghnrch‚ (lc) is it not an lmpious profanation
to transfer to another object, or rather to make a total change
in, God's sacred institution? For when they are ordained monks,
they are expressly forbidden to do things which the Lord enjoins
upon all presbytera. This direction is given to them: let a
monh be content in his cloister, and not presume to administer
the sacramenta or to executa any other braneh of public duty.
Let them deny, if they can, that it is a glanng mockery of God,
to create a presbyter in order that he may refrain from dischar-
ging his true and genuine office, and to gire a man the name,
who cannot possess the thing.
