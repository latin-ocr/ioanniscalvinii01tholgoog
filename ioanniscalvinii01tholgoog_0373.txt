tion—a source from which have issued innumerable human
traditione, the most pestilent and fatal to wretched souls. For
they have made no more scruple than the scribes and Pharisees
to “ lay on other men's shoulders burdens which they themselves
would not touch with one os their fingers.” (s ) lhave shown
in another place the extreme cruelty of their injunctions con·
coming auricular confession. Nono os their other laws discover
such enomrous violence ; but those which appear the most tole·
rable of them all, are tyrannically oppressiva to the conscience.
1 forbear to remark how they adulterato the worship os God,
and despoil God himself, who is the sole Legislator‚ of the
right which belongs to him. This power is now to be exa-
mined — whether the Church has authority to make laws which
shall bind the consciences of men. This question has nothing
todo with politicalorder31he only objecta ot' our present
attention are, that God may be rightly worshipped according
to the rulc be has prescribed, and that our spiritual liberty
which relatas to God may be preserved entire. Whatever
edicts have been issued by meu respecting the worship of God,
independently of his word, it has been customary to call
human traditione. Against such laws we contend, and not
against the holy and usesul constitutions os the Ohurch, which
contribute to the preservation ο1 discipline, or integrity, or peace.
The object for which we conterrd, is, to restraiu that overgrown
and barbarous empire, which is usurped over men’s souls by
those who wish to be accounted the pastore ο1 the Ohurch, but
who in reality are its most savage butchers. For they say
that the laws which they make are spiritual, pertaiuing to the
seul, and they affirm them to be necessary to eternal life. Thus,
as l have lately hinted, the kingdom of Christ is invaded;
thus the liberty given by him to the consciences of believers
is altogether subverted and destroyed. l sorbear to remark at
present with what great impiety they enforce the observauce
os their lawa, while they toach men to seek the pardon of their
sins and righteousness and salvation from it, and while they
make the whole os religion and piety to consist in it. 1 only
contend lor this one point, that no necessity ought to be im·
posed upon consciences iu things in which they have been set
at liberty by Christ ; and without this liberty, as 1 have before
observed, they can have no peace with God. They must
acknowledge Christ their Deliverer as their only King, and
must be governed by one law of liberty, even the sacred word
ο1 the gospel, is they wish to retain the grace which they have
once obtained in Christ ; they must submitto no slavery3 they
must be settered by no bonds.
