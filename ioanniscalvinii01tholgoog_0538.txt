will give is my flesh, which 1 will give sor the lise os the
world;’' (s) in which he clearly signifies, that his body
would be as bread to us, sor the spiritual lisa os the soul, be·
cause it was to be exposed to death sor our salvation3 and
that it is given to us to seed upon it, when he makes us parta·
kers os it by saith. He gave it once, therefore, to be made
bread, when he surrendered it to be cnrcified for the redemp-
tion os the world ; ha gives it daily, when, by the word of the
gospel, he presents it to us, that we may partake os it as cruci·
fied, when he confirms that presentation by the sacred mystery
os the supper; when he accomplishes within that which he
signifies without. Here it behoves us to guard against two
errors3 that, on the one band, we may not, by undervaluing
the signs, disjoin them from the mysteries with which they
are connected; nor, on the other hand, by extolling them
beyond measure, obscure the glory os the mysteries themselves.
That Christ is the bread os lise, by which believers are nou·
rished to eternal salvation, there is no man, not entirely destitute
os religion, who hesitates to acknowledge; but all are not
equally agreed respectiug the manner os partaking os him.
For there are some who define in a word, that to eat the flesh
os Christ, and to drink his blood, is no other than to believe in
Christ himself. But I conceive that, in that remarkable dis·
course, in which Christ recommends us to seed upon his body,
he intended to teach us something more striking and sub·
lime; namely, that wa ara quickened by a real participation
of him, which he designates by the terme os eating and
drinlcing, that no person might suppose the lise which we
receive from him to consist in simple knowledge. For as it
is not seeing, but eating bread, that administers nourishment
to tha body, so it is necessary sor the soul to bave a true and
complete participation os Christ, that by his power it may
be quickened to spiritual lise. At the same time, we consess
that there is no other eating thau by saith, as it is impossible
to imagine any other; but the difference between me and the
persons whose sentiment I arn opposing, is this; they consider
eating to be the very same as believing; I say, that in believing
we eat the flesh os Christ, because he is actually made ours by
saith, and that this eating is the sruit and effect os faith; or, to
express it more plainly, they consider the eating to be saith
itsels 3 but I apprehend it to be rather a consequence of saith.
The difference is small in words, but in the thing itself it is
considerable. For though the apostle teaches that “Christ
dwelleth in our hearts by saith,’' (g) yet no one will explain
this inhabitation to be saith itsels. Every one must perceive
