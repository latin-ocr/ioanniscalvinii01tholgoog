Creed,'’ which passes under the name of Cyprian, but they
particularly remark that there would be an impropriety in the
expression, if this proposition were inserted3 and they confirm
their opinion by no trivial reason. For we declare that we be·
lieve in God because our mind depends upon him as true, and
our confidence rests in him. But this would not be applicable
to the Church, any more than to “ the remission οῖ’ sins,” or
the “resurrection ol the body.” Therefore, thoughl am
averse to contentione about words, yet 1 would rather adopt a
proper phraseology adopted to express the subject than affect
forms os expression by which the subject would be urrnecessa-
rily involved in obscurity. The design os this clause is to
teach us, that though the davil moves every engine to destroy
the grece of Christ, and all the encmies of God exert the most
furious violence in the same attempt, yet his grace cannot
possibly be extinguished, nor ean his blood be rendered barren,
so as not to produce some fruit. Here we must regard both
the secret election of God, and his internel vocation3 because
he alone “ knoweth them that are his 3 ” and keeps them en·
closed under his “ seal,” to use the expression of Paul 5 (d)
except that they bear his impression, by which they may be
distinguished from the reprobate. But because a small and
contemptible number is concealed among a vast multitude, and
a lew grains of wheat are covered with a heap of cheff, we
must leave to God alone the knowledge os his Church whose
foundation ishis secret election. Notis it sufficient to in·
clude in our thoughts and minds the whole multitude of the
elect, unless we conceive oi such a unity of the Church, into
which we know ourselves to be truly ingraited. For unless
we are united with all the other members under Christour
Head, we cen have no hope of the future inheritauce. There·
sore the Church is called ceunomo, or universal ; because there
could not be two or three churches, without Christ being di-
vided, which is impossible. But all the elect of God are so
connected with each other in Christ, that as they depend upon
one head, so they grow up together as into one body, com-
pacted together like members os the same body; being made
truly one, as living by one saith, hope, and charity, through the
same Divine Spirit, being called not only to the same inherit-
ance of eternal lise, but also to a participetion osone God and
Christ. Therefore, though the melancholy desolation which
surrounds us, seems to proclaim that there is nothing left of the
Ohurch, let us remember that the death of Christ is lruitsul,
and that God wonderfully preserves his Church as it were in
biding-places3 according to what he said to Elijah: “l have
