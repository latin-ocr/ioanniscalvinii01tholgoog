assy,-that where the state of the nature is changed, it ise
speciosos death, and may without irupropriety be so called3
and therefore there is a perfect consistenee between these
things, that all will be removed by death when they put off
the mortal body, but that a separation of the body aud soul
will not be necessary, where there will be an instantaueous
ohange.

IX. But here arisesa question of greater difficulty. How
can the resurrection, which is a peculiar benefit of Christ, be
commonito the impious and the subjecta of the Divina curse?
We lrnow that in Adam all were sentenced to death ; (rr) Christ
eomes as “the resurrection aud the life ; ’¹ (s) but was it to
bestow life promiscuously on all mankind? But what would
be more improbable, than that they should attain, in their ob·
atinate blindness, what the pious worshippers of God recover
by saith alone? Yet it remeius certain, that one will be a re·
surrection to judgrnent, theotberto life; and that Christ will
come to ‘⁴ separate the sheep from the goata’' (y) Ireply, we
ought not to think that so very strange, which we see exem·
plified in our daily experience. We lrnow that in Adam we
lost the inheritance of the whole world, and have no more
right to the enjoyment of common eliments, than to the fruit
of the tree of life. How is it, then, that God not only “ malreth
his sun to rise on the evil and on the good,” (z) but that, for
the accommodatione of the present life, his inestimable liberality
isdifsused in the most copious abundauce? Hence we see,
that things which properly belong to Christ and his members,
ere also extended to the impious; not to become their legiti-
mate possession, but to render thern more inexcusable. 'l'hus
impious men frequently experience God's beneficenee in re·
markablc instaures, which sometimes exceed all the blessings
of the pious, but which, nevertheless, are the means of aggra-
vating their condemnation. If it be objected, that the resur·
rectiori is improperly compared with fleeting and terrestrial
advanteges, 1 reply again, that when men were first alienated
from God, the Fountain of life, they deserved the ruin of the
davil, to be altogether destroyed3 yet the wonderful counsel of
God devised a middle state, that without life they might live
in death. It ought not to be thought more unreasonable, if the
impious are raised from the dead, in order to be dragged to the
tribunal of Christ, whom they now refuse to hear as their Mas·
ter and Teacher. For it would be a slight punishment to be
destroyed by death, if they were not to be brought before the
Judge whose infinite and endless vangeauce they have in·
curred, to receive the punishmeuts due to their rebellion. But
