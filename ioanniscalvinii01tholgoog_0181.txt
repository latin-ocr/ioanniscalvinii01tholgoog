condemnation in the first man, the vessels that are formed from
it to honour, are not vessels of personal righteousness, but of
Divina mercy3 and the formation of others to dishonour, is to
be attributed, not to iniquity, but to the Divina decree,'' aa.
While God rewards those whom he rejects with ‹leserved punish·
ment, and to those whom he calls, freely gives rmdeserved grace,
he is liable to no accusation, but may be compared to a creditor,
who has power to release one,and enforce his demands on another.
The Lord, therefore, may give grace to whom he will, because
he is meroiful, and yet not give it to all, because ha is a just
judge3 may manifest his free grace, by giving to some what
, thoy never deservo, while, by not giving to all, he declares the
demerit of all. For when Paul says, that “God hath con·
cluded all under sin, that he might have mercy upon all,'' (l)
it must, at the same time, be added, that he is debtor ιο none;
forno man “ hath first given to him,'' ιο entitle him to demand

XII. Another argument often urged ιο overthrow predes-
tination is, that its establishment would destroy all solicitude
and exertion for rectitudo of conduct. For who cau hear,
they say, that either life or death is appointed for him by God’s
eternal and immutable decree, without immediately concluding
that ιι is of no importance how he eonducta himself ; since no
action of his can in any respect either impede or promote the
predestination of God? Thus all will abendon themselves to
despair, and run into every excess to which their licentious
propensities may laad them. And truly this objection is not
altogether destitute of truth; forthere ata many impura persons
who bespatter tha doctrine of predestination with these vile blas·
phemias, and with this pratext elude all admonitione and re·
proofs: God knows what he has determined to do with us:
if he has decreed our salvation, be will bring us to ιι ιιι his
own time, if he has destined us ιο death, ιι will be in vain for
us ιο strive against ιι. But the Scripture, while it inculcatas
superior awa and reverence of mind in tha consideration of so
great amystery, instructa the godly in every different con·
clusion, and fully refutes tha wicked and unreasonable in·
ferences of these persons. F'or the design of what it contains
respecting predestinationis, not that, being excited to presump-
tion, we may attempt, with nefarious temerity, to scrutinize the
inaccessible secreta of God, but rather that, being humbled aad
dejected, we may leam ιο tremble at his justice and admira his
mercy. At this object belicvers will aim. But the impure
cavils of the wicked are justly restrained by Paul. They
profess to go on securely in their vices ; because if they ara of
the number of the elect, such conduct will not prevent their
