Icrd receives his people 110111 labor into rest3 from affliction into
prosperity and happiness; srom sorrow into joy; 110111 poverty
into affluence 110111 ignomrny into glory and commutes all tho
evils which they have endured sor blessings of superior magni·
tude. So, likewise, it will occasron no inconvenience, 11 we con
sider holiness 01 life as the way, not which procures our admis-
sion into the glory 01 the heavenly kingdom, but through which
the electore conducted by their God to the manifestation of 1t;
since it is his good pleasure to glorify them whom he 1111
sanctified. Only let us not imagine a reciprocal relation 01
merit and reward, which is the error into which the sophista
1111, 101 want 01 cousidering the end which we have stated
But how preposterous is it, when the Lord calls our attention
to one end, 101 ns to direct our views to another! Nothing 11
clearer, than that the promise 01 1 reward to good works is de·
signed to afford some consolation to the weakness 01 our flesh,
but not to inflate our minda with vain-glory. Whoever, there·
fore, infers 110111 this, that there is any merit in works, or ba-
lances the work against the reward, errs very widely from the
true design 01 God.

V. Therefore, when the Scriptura says, that “ tha Lord, the
righteons Judge, shall give ’³ to his people “ a crown 01 right·
eousuess,’' (h) 1 not only reply with Augustino - “ 'Po whom
could the righteons Judge have given 1 crown, 11 the Father
01 mercies had never given grace? and how would it have
been an act 01 righteousness, 11 not preceded by that grace
which justifies the ungodly? how could these dne rewards be
rendered, unless those unmerited blessings were previously
bestowed?’¹ but lfnrther inquire-How could ha imputa
rightcousness to our works, unless his indulgent mercy had
concealed their unrighteonsnessl How could he esteem them
worthy 01 1 reward, unless 1111 infinite goodness had abolished
all their demerit 01 punishment? Augustino is in the habit
01 designating eternal lise by the word grace, because, when it
11 given 11 the reward 01 works, it is conferred on the gratui-
tous gista 01 God. But the Scriptura humbles us more, and at
the same time exalts us. Por beside prohibiting us to glory 111
works, because they ara the gratuitous gifts 01 God, it likewise
teaches us that they are always defiled by some pollutione ; 10
that they cannot satisfy God, if examined according to the rula
01 his judgment ; but it is also added, to prevent our despon-
dency, that they please him merely through his mercy. Now,
though Angustiae expresses himself somewhat differently srorn
us, yet that there is no real difference 01 sentiment will appear
110111 his language to Boniface. Alter a comparison between
