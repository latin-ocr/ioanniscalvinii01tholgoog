this is their profane complaint, Why should God impute as a
fault to man those things which were rendered necessary by
his predestinationi What should they do? Should they re·
sist his decrees? This would be vain, 101 11 would be impossi-
ble. Therefore they are not justly punished sor those things 01
which God's predestination is the priucipal cause. Here lshall
refrain from the defence commonly resorted to by ecclesiastical

, writers, that the foreknowledge 01 God preveuts not man from

being considered as a sinuer, since God ioresees man’s evils,
not his own. For then the cavil would not stop here3 it
would rather be urged, that still God might, 11 he would, have
provided against the evils he soresaw, and that not having
done this, he created man expressly 10 this end, that hc might
so conduct himself in the world ,· but is, by the Divine Provi-
dence, man was created in such astate as afterwards 10 (10
whatever he actually does, he ought not to be charged with
guilt sor things which he cannot avoid, and to which the will
01 God constrains him. Let us see, then, how this difficulty
should be solved. In the first place, the declaration 01 Solo·
mon ought 10 be universally admitted, that “ the Lord hath
made all things 101 himself ; yea, even the wicked 101 the day
01 evil.'’ (e) Observe3 all things being at God’s disposal, and
the decision 01 salvation or death belonging 10 him, he orders
all things by his conusel and decree in such a manner, that
some men are born devoted 110111 1110 womb to certain death,
that his name may be glorified in their destruction. 11 any
one pleads, that no necessity was imposed on thern by the
providence 01 God, but rather that they were created by him
in such a state in consequence 01 1110 soresight 01 their future
depravity, -it will amount to nothing. 'Phe old writers used,
indeed, 10 adopt this solution, though not without some degree
01 hesitation. But the schoolmen satissy themselves with it,
as though it admitted 01 uo opposition. Iwill readily grant, .
indeed, that mere soreknowledge lays no necessity on the
creatures, though this is not universally admitted ; 101 there are
some who maintain it 10 be the actual cause 01 what comesto
pass. But Valla, a man otherwise not much versed in theology,
appears to me to have discovered superior acuteness and judi·
ciousuess, by showing that this controversy is unnecessary,
because both 1110 aud death are 001001 God's will, rather than
01 1110 sorelsuowledge. 11 God simply soresaw the fates 01 men,
aud did not also dispose and fix them by his determination,
there would beroem 10 agitate the question, whether his pro·
vidence or soresight rendered them at all necessary. But since
ha 10100000 future events only in consequence 01 his decrea,
