eaten in a carnal manner, carried away with this prejudice,
they found it necessary to invent that subtlety, which the
whole tenor of the Scripture contradicts. 'I'hat we derogata
any thing from the power ol God, is so sar from being true, that
our doctrine peculiarly tends to magnify it. Butes they never
cease to accuse us of defrauding God of his due honour, by a
rejection of every thing which natural reason finds it difficult
to believe, though promised by the mouth os Christ himself,
1 repeat the answer which l have lately given, that we consult
not natural reason respecting the mysteries os saith, but that,
with the placid docility and gentleness of spirit recommended
by James, (b) we receive the doctrine which eomes down from
heaven. Yet, in a point in which they run into a pernicious
error, 1 admit that we pursue a useful moderatiori. On hearing
the words of Christ, “ This is mybody,'’ they imagine amiracle
the most distant froin his intention. This notion gives birth to
prodigious absurdities ; but, having already embarrassed them·

opposition mede to it by the wisdom of this world ; we even
impose restraints on our own minda, that they may not dare to
utter a word os cavil, and lreep them humble to prevent their
murmuring against the authority os God. Hence has proceeded
that expositiones the words of Christ, which all, who are but
moderately versed in the Scriptura, know to be agreeable to its
invariable usage respecting sacramenta. Nor do we esteem it
unlawful, in a difficult case, aster the example of the holy
virgin, to inquire how it can be. (c)

the saith of true believers, than a knowledge that the doctrine
which we have advanced is drawn srorn the pure word of God,
and rests upon its authority, l will demonstrate this with all
possible brevity. It is not from Aristotle, but from the Holy
Spirit, that we have learned that the body of Christ, since its
resurrectionis limited, and received into heaven till the last
