Tne preceding discussion respecting the sacramente might
satisfy persons os docile and sober minds, that they ought not
to carry their curiosity any further, or without the sanction os
the word of God, to receive any other sacraments beside those
two which they know to have been instituted by the Lord.
But as the opinion os seven sacraments has been so generally
