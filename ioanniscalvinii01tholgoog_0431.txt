an external ceremony, which, with all the rest, terminated in
Christ. Ireply, that even at this day it is, as it always has
been, a most excellent assistance and usesul admonition to
believers to stimulate thern, and guard thern against further
provocations os God by their carelessness and inattention, when
they are chastised by his scourges. Thereiore, when Christ
excuses his apostles for not iasting, he does not say that fast-
iugis abolished,but appoints it sor seasorrs of calamity, and ·
connects it with sorrow. “The days will come,’' says he,
‘⁴ when the bridegroom shall be taken away srorn them.'’ (z)

XVIII. That there may be no mistalre respecting the term,
let us detine what sasting is. For we do not understand it to
denote mere temperance and abstinence in eating and drinking,
but something more. 'Phe lise oi believers, indeed, ought to
be so regulated by frugality and sobriety, as to exhibit, as far
as possible, the appearance oia perpetual fast. But beside
this, there is another temporary fast, when we retrench any
thing from our customary mode os living, either ior a day or
ior any certain time, and prescribe to ourselvesa more than
commonly rigid and severe abstinence in iood. This restrictiori
consists in three things, -in time, in quality, and in quantity
of sood. By time, Ι mean that we should perform, while fast·
ing, those exercises on account os which fasts are instituted.
Aa, for example, ii any one fast for solemn prayer, he should
not break his last till he has attended to it. 'I'he quality
consists iu an entire abstinence from dainties, and contentment
with simplet and humbler iare, that our appetite may not be
stimulated by delicacies. The rule oi quantity is, that we eat
more sparingly aud slightly than usual, only ior necessity, and
not sor pleasure.

XlX. But it is necessary ior us, above all things, to be par-
ticularly on our guard against the approaches of superstition,
which has heretofore been a source os great injnry to the
Church. Ferit were sar better that iasting should be entirely
disused, than that the practice should be diligently observed,
and at the same tirne corrupted with false and pernicious opin-
ions, into which the world is continually falling, unless it be
prevented by the greatest fidelity and prudence of tlte pastors.
The first cantion necessary, and which they should be con-
stantly urging, is that suggested by Joel: “Rend your heart,
and not your garmeuts; ’³ (a) that is, they should admonish
the people, that God sets no value on fasting, unless it be
accompanied with a correspondent disposition of heart, areal
displeasure against sin, sincere seli-abhorrence, true humiliation,
and unfeigned grief arising srorn a sear oi God; and that sast-
