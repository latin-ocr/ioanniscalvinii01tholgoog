and gratitudo of mind. For which reason the apostle said,
“ The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the communion
of the blood of Christ? The bread which we break, is it not
the communion of the body of Christi '³ (v) Nor is there any
cause to object, that it isa figurative expression, by which the
name of the thing signified is given to the sign. l grant, in-
deed, that the breaking of the bread is symbolical, and not the
substance itself: yet, this being admitted, from the exhibition
of the symbol we may justly infer the exhibition of the snb-
stance; for, unless any one would call God a deceiver, he cau
never presume to affirm that he sets before us an empty sign.
Therefore, if, by the breaking of the bread, the Lord truly rc-
presents the participation of his body, it ought not to be doubted
that he truly presents and communicatas it. And it must al-
ways be a rule with believcrs, whenever they see the signs
instituted by the Lord, to assure and persuade themselves that
they are also accompanied with the truth of the thing signified.
Porto what eud would the Lord deliver into our hands the
symbol of his body, except to assure us of a real participation
of iti lf it be true that the visible sign is given to us to scal
the donation of the invisible substance, we ought to entertain
a confident assurance, that in receiving the symbolos his body,
we at the same time truly receive the body itself.

XI. ln harmony‚ therefore, with the doctrine which has
always been received in the Church, and which is maintained
in the present ‹lay by all who hold right sentimental say, that
the sacred mystery of the supper consists of two parts: the
corporeal signs, which, being placed before our eyes, represent
to us invisible things in a manner adapted to the wealrness of
our capacities; and the spiritual truth, which is at the same
time typified and exhibited by those symbols. When 1 intend
to give a familiar view of this truth, lam accustomed to state
three particulars which it includes: the signification3 the mat-
ter, or substance, which depends on the signification3 and the
virtue, or effect, which follows from both. 'Phe signification
consists in the promises which are interwoven with the sign.
What I call the matter or substance, is Christ, with his death
and resurrection. By the effect, I mean redemption, righteous-
ness, sanctification, eternal life, and all the other benefits
which Christ confers upon us. Now, though all these things
are connected with saith, yet l leave no room for this cavil;
as though, when l say that Christ is received by faith,l in-
tended that he is received merely in the understanding and
imagination3 for the promises present him to ns, not that we
may rest in mere contemplation and simple knowledge, but
