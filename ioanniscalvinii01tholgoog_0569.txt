yet by direct implication; and not content with this, they
attribute to it qualities utterly incompatible with each other;
whence it follows, of necessity, that he must heve two bodies.

XXX. Though we should grant them what they contend
sor, respecting its invisible presence, still this would be no proof
os its infinity, without which it will bea vain attempt to
enclose Christ under the breed. Unless the body os Christ he
capable os being every where at once, without any {imitation
os place, it will not be credible that it is concealed under the
bread in the sacred supper. lt was this necessity which caused
them to introduce their monstrous notion os its ubiquity. But
it has been shown, by clear and strong testimonies of Scripture,
that the body of Christ was, lilre other human bodies, circum-
scribed by certain dimensions; and its ascension to heaven
made it evideut that it was not in all places, but that it left
one place, when it removed to another. Nor is the promise,
“l am with you always, eren unto the end of the world,'' (r)
to be applied, as they suppose it should be, to his body. In
the first place, on this supposition, there will be no such per-
petual connection, unless Christ dwells in usin acorporeal
manner, without the use of the sacrarneutal supper; and there-
fore they baveno sufficient cause sor contending so fiercely
respecting the words os Christ, in order to enclosc Christ under
the broad. lu the next place, the context evinces, that Christ
there has not the most distant reference to his flesh, but pro·
mises his disciples invincible aid to sustain and defend them
against all the assaults of Satan and the world. For having
assigned them a difficult province, to encourage thern to under-
take it without hesitation, and to discharge it with undaunted
resolution,he supports them with the assurance of his presence ;
as though he had said, they should never want his aid, which
nothing could overcome. Unless these nien wished to involve
every thing in confusion, ought they not to distinguish the
nature of this presence? lt is evident that some persons would
rather incur the greatest disgrace by betraying their ignorance‚
than relinquish even the least particle of their error. [speak
notos the Romanists, whose doctrine is more tolerable, or at
least more modest; but some are so carried away with the
beatos contentiori, asto affirm that, on account of the union
of the two natures in Christ, wherever his Divinity is, his flesb,
which cannot he separated srorn it, is there also ; as is that union
had miugled the two natures so as to lorrn some intermediate
kind of being, which is neither God nor man. This notion was
maintained by Eutyches, and since his time by Servetus. But
it is clearly ascertained from the Scriptum, that in the one
