which a man is instructed in the duties of humanity and civi-
lity, which are to be observed in aa intercourse with mankind.
They are generally, and not improperly, denominated the
spiritual and tha temporal jurisdiction3 indicating that the
former species of govemment pertains to the life of the soul, and
that the latter relates to the concerns of the present state; not
only to the provision of food aad clothing, but to the enactment
of laws to regulate a man’s life among his neighbours by thc
rules of holiness, integrity, and sobriety. For the former has its
seat in the interior of the mind, whilst the latter only directs
the external conduct: one may be tenned a spiritual kingdom,
aud the other a political one. But these two, as we have dis·
tinguished them, always require to be considered separately;
aad while the oue is under discussion, the mind must be ab·
stracted from all consideration of the other. For man contains,
as it were, two worlds, capable of being govemed by various
rulers aud various laws. This distinction will prevent what
the gospel inculcates conceming spiritual liberty from being
misepplied to political regulatious; as though Christians were
less subject to the externol governmsnt of human laws, because
their consciences have been set at liberty before God; as
though their freedom of spirit necessarily exempted them from
all carnal servitude. Agaiu, because evan in those constitutions
which seem to pertain to the spiritual kingdom, there may
possibly be some deception, it is necessary to discriminate
between these slso; which are to be accounted legitimate, as
according with the Divino word, and which, on the contrary,
ought not to be received among believers. Of civil govern-
ment·l shall treat in another placa. Of ecclesiastical laws
also 1 forbear to speak at present3 because a full discussion of
thern will be proper in the Fourth Book, where we shall treat
of the power of the Church. But we shall conclude the present
, argument in the following manner: The question, which, as Ι
have observed, is in itself not vary obscure or intricate, greatly
perplexos many, because they donor distinguish with sufficient
precision between the extemnl jurisdiction aad the court of
conscience. 'Phe difficulty is increased by Paul’s injunctiou to
obey magistrates “not only for wrath, but also for conscience'
sake ; '' (q) from which it should follow, that the conscience also
is bound by political laws. But if this were true, it would
supersede all that we have already said, or are now about to
say, respecting spiritual government. For the solution of this
difficulty, it will be of use, first, to know what conscience is.
And the definition of it must bc derived frorn the etymology of
the word. For as, when men apprehend tha knowledge of
