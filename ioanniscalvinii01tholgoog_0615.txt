practice, and introduced 1 know not what connterfeit confirma·
tion as a sacrament of God. They have pretended that the
virtue of confirmation is to give the Holy Spirit for the aug·
mentation of grace, who in baptism is given for innocence; to
strengthen for warfare those who in baptism had been re·
generated to life. This confirmation is performed by unction
and the following form of words: “l sign thee with the sign
of the cross, and confirm thee with the chrism of salvatiou, in
the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy
Spirit.” All this sounds very beautifully and pleasantly. But
where is the word of God which promises the presence of the
Holy Spirit in this ceremony? They cannot allege a single iota
How, then, will they assure us that their chrism is the vessel
of the Holy Spirit? We see oil, a thick and viscid liquid, and
we see nothing besides Augustine says, “ Let the word be
added to the clement, arrd it will become asacrament.’' Let the
Romanists produce this word, if they wish ns to contemplate
in the oil any thing beyond the oil itself. lf they acknowledged
themselves ministers of the sacramente, as they ought to do,
there would be no need of any further contention. The first
law of a minister is to undertake nothing without a command.
Now, let thern produce any command for this service, and 1 will
not add another word on the subject. If they have no com·
mand, they can have no excuse for such sacrilegious audacity.
On the same principle, orn Lord interrogated the Pharisees:
“The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven or of
men ?” (lc) If they had answered, From men, he would have
extorted a confession that it was vain and frivolous; if, From
heaven, they would be constrained to admit the doctrine of J ohn.
To avoid too great an injnry to John, therefore, they did not dare
to confess it was from men. So, if confirmation be “of men,”
it is evinced to be vain and frivolons ; if they wish to persuade
us that it is from heaven, let thern prove it.

Vl. They defend themselves, indeed, hythe example of the
apostles, whom they consider as having done nothing without
sufficient reason. This consideration is correct 3 nor would
they receive any reprehension from us, if they showed them-
selves imitators of the apostles. But what was the practice of
the apostles? Lulre relates, that “when the apostles, which
were at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria had received the word
of God, they sent unto them Peter and John ; who, when they
were corne down, prayed for them, that they might receive the
Holy Ghost; foras yet he was fallen upon none of them; only
they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesns. Then laid
they their hands on them, and they received the Holy Ghost.’' (l)
