bable, however, that man procured his own destruction by the

tate, therefore, to confess plainly with Augustino, “that the
will of God is the necessity of things, and that what he has
willed will necessarily corne to pass, as those things are really
about to happen which he has foreseen.'' Now, if either Pela·

are concerned with these four sects on this argument) in ex·

to revolt from his God? Lest it should be thought to corne
from creation, God had approved and commended what had

he corrupted the nature he had received pure from the 110111,
