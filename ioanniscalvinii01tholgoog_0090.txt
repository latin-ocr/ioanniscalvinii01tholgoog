his name may be hallowed, or sanctified, we ought (so to spealr)
ardently to hunger and thirst for that sanctification.

Vll. If any man object, that we are not always urged to
pray by the same necessity, this l grant, and this distinction is
usefully represented to us by James: “ Is any among you af-
flicted? let him pray. ls any merry? let him sing psalms.'' (l)
Common sense itself therefore dictales, that because of our
extreme indolence, we are the more vigorously stimulated by
God to earnestness in prayer according to the exigencies of our

,condition And this David calls “ a time when God may be
found,'’ (m) because (as he reaches in many other places) the
more severely we are oppressed by troubles, disasters, fears, and
other kinds of temptations‚ we have the greater liberty of acccss
to God, as though he then particularly invited us to approach
him. At the same time, it is equally true that we ought to be,
as Paul says, “ praying always,” (n) because, how great soever
we may believe tlre prosperity of our affairs, and though we are
surrounded on every side by matter of joy, yet there is no mo·
ment of time in which our necessity does not furnish incite-
ments to prayer. Does any one abound in wine and corn?
Since he cannot eujoy a morsel of broad but by the continual
favour of God, his cellars or barns afford no objection to his
praying for daily bread. Now, if we reflect how many dangers
threaten us every moment, sear itself will teach us that there is
no time in which prayer is unsuitable to us. Yet this may be
discovered still better in spiritual concerns. For when will so
many sins, of which we are conscions, suffer us to remain in
security, without humbly deprecating both the guilt and the
punishment? When will temptations grant usa truce, so that
we need not be in haste to obtain assistance? Besides, an
ardent desire os the Divina kingdom and glory ought irresisti-
bly to attract us, not by intervals, but without intermission,
rendering every season equally snitahle. It is not in vain,
therefore, that assiduity in prayer is so frequently enjoined. Ι
