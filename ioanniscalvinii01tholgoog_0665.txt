tration which requires to be corrected, let them not raise any
tumults, or take the business into their own hands, which ought
to be all bound in this respect, but let them refer it to the cog·
nizancc os the magistrate, who is alone autlrorized to regulate
the correctns os the public. 1 mean, that they ought to attempt
nothing without being commanded3 for when they have the
command os a governor, then they also are investcd with pub-
lic authority. For, as we arc accustomed to call the coun-
sellors of aprince his eyes and cars, so they may not unaptly
be called lrr's hands whom he has commissioned to execute
his commands.

XXIV. Now, as we have hitherto described a magistrate
who truly answerstohis title; who is the father of hiscountry,
and, as the poet calls him, the pastor of bis people‚ tlre guardian
of peace, the protector of justice, the avenger of innocence;
hc would justly be deemed insane who disapproved of such a
government. But, as it has happened, irr almost all ages, that
some princeS, regardless os every thing to which they ought to
have directed their attention and provision, give themselves
up to their pleasures in indolem exemption from every care;
others, absorbcd in their own interest, expose to sale all laws,
privileges, rights, and jndgments; others plrrnder tlre public
of wealth, which they afterwards lavish in mad prodigality;
others commit flagrant outrages, pillaging houses, violating vir-
gins arrd matronS, and mrrrdering insarrts; many persons cannot
be persuaded that such ought to be ackrrowledged as princes,
whom, as sar as possible, they ought to obey. For in such
enorrnities, and actions so completely incompatible, not only
with the office of amagistrate, but with tlrc duty of every
marr, they discover no appearance os the image os God, which
ought to be conspicuous in a magistrate ; while they perceive
no vestigo of that minister of God who is “not a terror to good
worlrs,brrt to the evil,’' who issent “for tlre punishment ol'
evildoers, and sor the praise ol thern that do well ; ’² nor recog-
nize that governor, whose dignity arrd authority the Scriptnre
recommends to us. And certainly the minds ol men have
always been naturally disposed to hate and execrate tyrants as
· much as to love and reverence legitimate lrings.

XXV. But, if we direct our attention to the word of God,
it will carry us much further3 even to submit to the government,
not only of those princes who discharge their duty to us with
becoming integrity and fidelity, bnt of all who possess the
sovereigrrty, even though they perform none of the duties os
their function. For, though the Lord testifies that the magis·
trate isan eminent gift os his liberality to preserve the safety
ot' men, and prescribes to magistrates themselves the extent
of their duty, yet he at the same time declares, that whatever
