lV. 11 we advert to the apostles, they are certainly honoured
with many extraordinary characters. lt is said that they are
“the light 01 the world,” and “the salt of the earth; '’ (c) that
‘⁴ 110 that heareth ’' 111001 “heareth Christ ; ’' (10) that ’10110100-
ever '' they “shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and
whatsoever ” they “shall loose on earth shall be loosed in hea-
ven.” (a) But their very name shows what degree of liberty
they were allowed in their office ; that if they wereapostles, they
were not to declaim according to their own pleasure, but to de·
liver with strict fidelity the commende 01 him who had sent thern.
And the language of Christ is sufficiently clear, in which he has
defined their message by the following 0001101001οο r “ Go ye,
aad 100011 011 natione whatsoever l have commanded you.” (y)
He had even received and imposed on himself the same law,
in order that no one might refuse to submit to it. “My doc·
trine,” says 110, “ is not mine, but his that sent me.” (z) He
who was always the eternal and only counsellor 01 the Father,
and was constituted by the Father the Lord and Master of all,
yet because he sustained the office 01 a teacher, prescribed, by
his own example, the 1010 which all ministers ought to follow
in their teaching. 'Phe power 01 1110 Church, therefore, 10001
00111011οᾱ, but subject to the word 01 the lord, and, as it were,
included in it. .

V. But whereas it 1100110000 principle received in the
01101011110111 the beginning, and ought 10 be admitted in the
present day, that the servants 01 God should tcach nothing
which they have not learned from him, yet they have had dif-
ferent modes of receiving instruction from him, according to the
variety of different periods3 and the present mode differs from
those which have preceded it. ln the first place, if the asser·
tion 01 Christ be true, that “no man knoweth the Father
except the 800, and 110 10 whomsoever the Son will reveal
him,'' (a) it must always have been necessary for those who
would arrivs at the knowledge of God, to be directed by that
eternal wisdom. For how could they have comprehended the
mysteries of God, 01 how could they have declared thern,
except by the teaching 01 him, 1ο whom alone the 0001010 01
the Father are intimately known? 'Phe saints in former ages,
therefore, had no 011101 knowledge of God than what they
obtained by beholding him in the 8011, as 1001011101. By this
