others, as he required them to maintaiu his “Nor under the
influence of ambition,'' says he, “do I withhold from euy one
thet which is his right; but Ι desire to honour my brethren in
all things’'-There is not a sentence iu his writings which
contains a prouder boast of the majesty of his primacy than the
following: “I know no bishop who is not subject to the apos-
tolic see, when he is found in fault.'’ But he immediately
adds, “ Where there is no fault to require subjection, all are

that he is ready to be reproved by all, and to be corrected by
all. So in another epistle he commando the bishop of Aquileia
to corne to Rome to plead his cause iu a controversy which

of faith3 nevertheless he gives this command, not from his
own authority, but in consequence of the mandate of the em·
