heirs of that coveuaut‚ aud distinguished from the children of
the impious, were called a holy seed ; and for the same reason,
the children of christinus, oven when only one of the parents
is pinus, are accounted holy, aud according to the testimony
of the apostle, differ from the impure seed ot' idolaters. Now,
as the Lord, immediately after having made the coveuant with
Abraham, commanded it to bc sealed in insauts by an external
sacrament, what cause will Christiana assrgu why they should
uot also at this day testisy aud scal the same iu their children?
Nor let it be objected, that the Lord commanded not his cove-
uant to be confirmed by any other symbol thau that of cir·
cumcisiou, which has long ago beeu abolished. For it is easy
to reply, that during the time of the Old Testameut he ap
pointed circumcisiou for the confirmation of his covenant; but
that since the abrogatiou of circumcision, there always remaius
the same reason for confirming it, which we have in common
with the Jews. It is necessary, therefore, to be careful in ob-
serving what we have in common with them, aad what they
had different from us. The covenant is common, the reason
for confirming it is common. Only the mode of confirmation
is different ; for to them it was confirmed by circumcisiou,
which among us has been succeeded by baptism. Otherwise,
if the testimony by which the Jews were assured of the salva-
tiou of their seed be talren away from us, the effect of the ad-
vent of Christ has been to render the grace os God more obscure
aud less attested to us than it was to the Jews. lf this carmot
be affirmed without great dishonour to Christ, by whom the
infinite goodness of God has been diffused over the earth, and
manifested to men iu a more conspicuous and liberal manner
than at any former period, we must be obliged to consess, that
at least it ought not to be more concealed or less attested than
under the obscure shadows of the law.

Vll. Wherefore the Lord Jesus, to exhibit a specimen from
which the world might understand that he was come to extend
rather thau to limit the mercy of the Father, kindly received the
infants that were presented to him, aud embraced them in his
arms, chidiug his disciples who endeavoured to forbid their ap-
proach to him, because they would lreep those, of whom was the
kingdom of heaven, at a distance from him who is the only way
of entrance iuto it. But some will object, What resemblance
does this embrace os Christ bear to baptism l for he is not said
to have baptizcd them, but to have received them, taken them
in his arma, audblessed them; therefore, if we desire to imitate
his example, let us assist iufauts with our prayers‚ but let us
not baptize them. But it is necessary to consider the conduct
of Christ with more attention thau it receives from persons of

this class. For it is uot to be passed overas a thing of little
