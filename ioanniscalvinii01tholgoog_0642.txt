CHAPTER XX.

ΟΝ ΟΝΙΙι COVERNMENT.

Hivruo already stated that man is the subject of two kinds
of government, and having sufficiently discussed that which
is situated in the soul, or the inner man, aud relates to eternal
life,-we are, in this chapter, to say something of the other
kind, which relates to civil justice, and the regulation of the
external conduct. For, though the nature of this argument
seems to have no connection with the spiritual doctrine of saith
which I have undertakeu to discuss, the sequel will show that
l have sufficient reason for connecting them together, and, in·
deed, that necessity obliges me to it; especially since, on the
one hand, infatuated and barbarous men madly endeavour to
subvert this ordinance established by God, and, on the other
hand, the flatterers of princes, extolling their power beyond all
just bounds, hesitate not to oppose it to the authority of God
himself. Unless both these errors be resisted, the purity of the
saith will be destroyed. Besides, it is of no small importance
for us to know what benevolent provision God has made for
mankind in this instance, that we may be stimulated by a
greater degree of picus real to testify our gratitudo. ln the
first place, before we enter ou the subject itself, it is necessary
for us to recur to the distinction which we have already esta-
blished, lest we fall into an error very common in the world,
and injudiciously confound together these two things, the
nature of which is altogether different. For some men, when
they hear that the gospel promises a liberty which acknow-
ledges no king or nragistrate among men, but submits to Christ
alone, think they carr enjoy no advantage of their liberty,
while they see any power exalted above them. They ima·
gine, therefore, that nothing will prosper, unless the whole
world be modelled in a new form, without any tribunals, or
laws, or magistrates, or any thing of a similar kind, which they
consider injurious to their liberty. But he who knows how
to distinguish between the body and the soul, between this
present transitory life and the future eternal one, will find no
difficulty iu understanding, that the spiritual kingdom of
Christ and civil govemment are things very different and
remote from each other. Since it is a Jewish folly, therefore,
to seek and include the kingdom of Christ under the elements
of this world, let us, on the contrary, considering what the
Scripture clearly inculcates, that the benefit which is received
