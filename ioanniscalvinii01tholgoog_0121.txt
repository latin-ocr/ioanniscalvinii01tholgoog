with more ardent devotion on the pressure of any necessity
unusually great. But the place ιο speak of perseverance, which
is nearly sllied ιο unceasing diligence, will be towards the end.
Moreover these things afford no encouragement ιο those vain
repetitions which Christ bas chosen to interdict us ; (r) for he
does not forbid us to pray long or frequently, or with great
fervour of affection; but he forbids us to confide in our ability
to extort any thing from God by stunning his ears with gar·
rulous loquacity, ss though he were to be influenced by the arts
of human persuasion. For we know that hypocrites, who do
not consider that they are concerned with God, are as pompous
iu their prayers as in a triumph. For that Pharisee, who
thanked God that he was not like other men, (y) undoubtedly
flattered himself in the eyes of men, as if he wished to gain by
his prayer the reputation of sanctity. Hence that βαπολιγια (vain
repetition) which from a similar cause at present prevailsamong
the Papists3 while some vainly consume the time by reite·
rating the same oraisons, and others recommend themselves
among the vulgar by a tedicus accumulation of words. Since
this garrulity is spuerile mocking of God, we need not wonder
that it is prohibited in the Church, that nothing may be heard
there but what is serious, and proceeds from the very heart.
Very similar to this corrupt practice is another, which Christ
condemns at the same time 3 that hypocritas, for the sake of
ostentation, seelr alter many witnesses of their devotione, and
rather pray in the market-place, than that their prayers should
want the applause of the world. But as it has been already
observed that the end of prayer is ιο elevate our minds towards
God, both in a confession of his praise and in a supplication of
his aid, we may learn from this that its principal place is in the
mind and heart3 or, rather, that prayer itself is the desire of the
inmost heart, which is poured out and laid before God the
searcher of hearto. Wherefore our heavenly 'ferchenes has
already been mentioned, when he intended to deliver the best
rule respecting prayer, gave the following command: “ Enter
into thy closet, and when thou hast shut thy door, pray ιο thy
Father which is in secret; and thy Father which seeth in
secret shall reward thee openly.’' (z) For when he has dis·
suaded from imitating the example of hypocritas, who endea-
voured by the arnbitious ostentation of their prayers to gain the
favour of men, he immediately adds a better direction, which is,
to enter into our closet, and there to pray with the door shut.
In which words, as 1 understand thern, he has taught us ιο seek
retirement, that we may be enabled to descend into our own
hearts, with all our powers of reflection, and promised us that
