as many as had no sufficient excuse, were commanded to be
present, was that there might be a more solemn examination
into the learning and morals of the person to be ordained; sor
the business was not completed without examination. And it
appears from the epistles os Cyprian, that in the beginning the
bishops were not invited aster the electiori, but used to be
present at the election, and that for the purpose os acting as
moderatore, that nothing turbulent might take place among the
multitude For after having said that the people hare the
power either to choose the worthy for priests, or to reject the

of Italy went to Rome to be consecrated. unis may be seen
by the epistles of Gregory. Onlya few citios, which did not so

example recorded by him in the case ol Milan. Perhaps the
metropolitan cities were the only ones that retained their privi-
