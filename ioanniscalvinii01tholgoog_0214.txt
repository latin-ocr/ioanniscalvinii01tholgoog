it resta, is temporary. Lastly, either these persons are ex·
tremely ignorant of all Divine things, or they are striving, with
malignam perverseness, to overturn all the grace of God and
power of Christ3 and these can never be perfectly fulfilled till
sin is abolishcd, and death swallowed up, and eternal life
completely established. But the folly of being afraid that too
much cruelty is attributed to God, if the reprobate are doomed
to eternal punishment, is even evident to the blind. Will the
Lord do any injury by refusing tha enjoyment of his kingdom
to persons whose ingratitude shall have rendered them unwor-
thy of it? But their sins are temporary. Thisl grant, but
the majesty of God, as well as his justice, which their sins
have violated, is eternal. Their iniquity, therefore, is justly
remembered. Then the punishment is alleged to be arcessire, ¹
being disproportioned to the crime. But this is intolerable
blasphemy, when the majesty of God is so little valued‚ when
the contemptos it is considered of no more consequence than
the destruction of one soul. But let us pass by these triflers3
lest, contrary to what we have before said, we should appear
to consider their reverias as worthy of refutation.

Vl. Besidc these wild notions, the perverse curiosity of man
has introduced two others. b'ome have supposed that the

whole man dies, and that souls are raised again together with
bodies, others, admitting the immortality of souls, suppose they
will bc clothed with new bodies, and thereby deuy the resur·
rectiori of the flesh. As Ι have touched on the former of these
notions in the creationes man, it will be sufficient again tu
apprize my readers, that it is a brutish error, to represent tha
spirit, formed after the image of God, as a fleeting breath which
animares the body only during this perishable life, and to anni·
lrilate the temple of the Holy Spirit3 in short, to despoil that

that the condition of the body must be better and more excel·
lent than that of the soul. Very different is the doctrine of
Scriptura, which compares the body to a habitation, from which
we depart at death3 because it estimates us by that part of our
nature which constitutas the distinction between us and the
brutes. Thus Peter, when near his death, says, “Shortly 1
must put off this my tabernacle.'' (d) And Paul, speaking of
believers, having said that “ if our sarthly house of this taber·
