nant. But noW, since we have the Lord Jesus, in whose hand
the eternal covenant of mercy is not only made but confirmed
to us, —whose name should wc rather plead in our prayers?
And since these good doctors contend that the patriarcha arc iu
these words represented as intercessus, 1 wish to be informed
by thern, why, in such a vast multitude, no place, not even the
lowest among them, is allotted to Abraham, the father of
the Ohurchl From what vile source they darive their advocates,
is well known. let them answer me by proving it right, that
Abraham, whom God has preferred to all others, and elevated
to the highest degree os honour, should be neglected and sup-
presscd. The truth is, that since this practice was unknown in
the ancient Ohurch, they thought proper, in order to conceal
its novelty, to be silent respecting the ancient sathers; as
though the difference oi names were a valid excuse for a recent
and corrupt custom. But the objection urged by some, that
God is entreated to have mercy on the people sor the sake of
David, is so sar from supporting their error, that it is a decisive
refutation os it. Foris we consider the character sustained by
David, he is selected from the whole company of theasium,
that God may fulfil the coveuaut which he made with him,
so that it refers to the covcnant, rather than to the person, and
contains a figurative declaration of the sole intercession os
Christ. For it is certain that what was peculiar to David,
as being a type os Christ, is irrapplicable to any others.

XXVI. But it seems that some are influenced by the sre-
queut declaratione which we read, that the prayers os the
saints are heard. Why? Truly because they have prayed.
“They cried unto thec,” says the Psalmist, “and were de-
livered3 they trusted in thee, and were not confouudcd.’'(t)
Therefore, let us likewise pray after their example, that we may
obtain a similar audience. But these men preposterously argue,
that none will be heard but such as have been once already
heard. How much more properly does Jamcs say, “Elias
was a man subject to like passions as wa are, and he prayed
caruestly that it might not rain; and it rained not on the earth
by the space of three years and six months. And he prayed
again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth brought sorth
her fruit.'’ (u) What! does he inser any peculiar privilege os
Elias, to which we should have recourse? Not at all; but he
shows the perpetual efficacy oi pure aud pious prayer, to ex·
hort us to pray in a similar manner. For wc put a mean con·
struction on the promptitude aud benignity os God in hearing
them, unless we be encouraged by such instances to a firmet
reliance on his promises; in which he promises to hear, not
one or two, or even a serv, but all who call uppu his name.
