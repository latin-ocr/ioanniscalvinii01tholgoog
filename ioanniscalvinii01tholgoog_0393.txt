XXIII. But it is contended, that though the ecclesiastical
laws should in a hundred instances be unjust and injurious to
us, yet they ought all to be obeyed without any exception; for
that the point here is not that we should consent to errors, but
that we, who are subjects, should fulfil even the severe com·
mands of our governors, which we are not at liberty to reject.
But here likewise the Lord most happily interposes with the
truth of his word, delivers us from such bondage, and estab-
lishes us in the liberty which he has procured for us by his
sacred blood, the benefit of which he has repeatedly confirmed
by his word. For the question henr is not, as they fallaciously
pretend, merely whether we shall endure some grievous op·
pression in our bodies3 but whether our conscienoes shall be
deprived of their liberty, that is, of the benefit of the blood of
Christ, and shall be tormented witha wretched bondage. Let
us, however, pass over this also, as if it were matter of little
importance. But do we think it a matter of little tmportmoe
to deprive the Lord of his kingdom, which he claims to him·
sels, in such a peremptory manner? And it is taken away frorn
him whenever he is worshipped with laws of human invention,
whereas he requires himself to be honored as the sole legislator
of his own worship. And that no one may suppose it to ba
athing of trivial importance, let us hear in what estimation it
isheld by the Lord. “Forasmrrch,” he says, “as this people
draw near me with their mouth, but their fear toward me is
taught by the precept of men, therefore, behold‚I will pro-
ceed to do amarvellous work among this people, even a mar·
vellous work and a wonder; for the wisdom of their wise men
shall perish, and the understanding of their prudent men shall be
hid.” (u) Again: “ Iu vain do they worship me, teaching sor
doctrines the commandments of men. ” (x) When the children
of Israel polluted themselves by various idolatries, the cause of
all the evil is attributed to the Impure mixture which they
made by devising new modes of worship in violation of the
commando of God. Therefore, the sacred history relates that
the strangers who had been transplanted by the king of Assyria
from Babylon to inhabit Samaria, were torn in pieces and de·
voured by wild beasrs, “because they knew not the statutos
or ordinances of the God of the land.'' 'Phough they had
committed no fault iu the ceremonies, yet vain pomp would
not have been approved by God3 but he did not fail to punIsh
the violation of his worship, when men introduced new iuven·
tions inconsistent with his word. Hence itis afterwards
