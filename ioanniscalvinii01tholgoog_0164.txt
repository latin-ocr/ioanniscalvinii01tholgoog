ing of the chosen people, whose condition was, to outward ap·
pearanca, all alilrc; as though he had said, that the common
adoption includes in it peculiar grace towards some, who re·
semble a more sacred treasure3 that the common covenant
preventa not this small number being exempted from the com·
mon lot; and that, determined to represent himself as the un·
controlled dispenset and arbiter in this affair, he positively
denies that he will have mercy on one rather than another,
from any other motiva than his own pleasure; because, when
mercy meets a person who seehs it, though he suffers no re·
pulse, yet he either anticipatos or in some degree obtains for
himself that favour, of which God claims to himself all the
rarse.

lel. Now, let the supreme Master and Judge decide the
whole matter. Beholding in his hearers such extreme obdu·
racy, that his discourses were scattered among the multitude
almost without any effect, to obviate this offence, he exclaims,
“All that the Father giveth me, shall come to me. And this
is the Father’s will, that of all which he hath given me,1
should lose nothing.'' (y) Observa, the origin is from the do-
nation os the Father, that we are given into the custody
and protectiones Christ. Here, perhaps, some one may argue
in a circle, and object, that none are considered as the Father’s
peculiar people, but those whose surrender has been voluntary,
arising from saith. But Christ only insiste on this point -that
notwithstanding the defections of vast multitudes, shalring the
whole world, yet the counsel of God will be stable and firmor
than the heavens, so that election can never fail. They are
said to have been the elect of the Father, before he gave them
to his only begotten Son. Is it inquired whether this was by
nature? No, he dravm those who were strangers, and so makes
them his children. The language of Christ is too clear to be
perplexed by the qnibbles of sophistry: ‘¹ No man can come to
me, except the Father draw him. Every man that hath heard ··
and learned of the Father, cometh unto me,’'(z) If all men
promiscuously submitted to Christ, election would be common:
now, the fewness of believers discovers a manifest distinction.
Having asserted his disciples therefore, who were given to him,
to be the peculiar portion of the Father, Christ a little after
adds, “l pray not for the world, but for them which thou hast

given me, for they are thine ; '² (a) which shows that the whole
world does not belong to its Creator; only that grace de
livers from the curse and wrath of God, and from eternal death,
a few, who would otherwise perish, but leaves the world in its
detunction, to which it has been destined. At the same time,
