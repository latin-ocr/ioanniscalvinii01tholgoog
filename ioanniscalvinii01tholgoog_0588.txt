deportment worthy of Christians. Finally, thanksgivings
should be rendered, and praises sung, to God; and to close the
whole, the Ohurch should be dismissed in peace.

XLIV. The observations which wehave already made re·
specting the sacrament, abundantly show that it was not in·
stituted for the purpose of being received once in a year, aud
that in acarelcss and formal manner, as is now the gene
ral practice3 but in order to be frequently celebrated by all
Christiana, that they might often call to mind the sufferings of
Christ 3 the recollection of which would sustain and strengthen
their saith, would incite them to sing praises to God, and to
confess and celebrate his goodness, and would also cherish in
their hearts, and promote the mutual exercise of that charity,
the bond of which they would see in the unity of the body of
Christ. For whenever we communicate in the symbol of the
Lord’s body, it is like the interchangc of a mutual pledge, by
which we reciprocally bind ourselves to all the duties of ,
charity, that no one among us will do any thing by which he
may injure his brother, or will omit any thing by which he
can assist him, when necessity requires and opportunity admits.
That such was the practice of the apostolic Ghurch, is men·
tioned by Lukc, when he says that believers “continued stcad·
fastly in the apostles’ doctrine and fellowship, and in breaking of
bread, and in prayers.” (p) The invariable custom, therefore,
was, that no assembly of the Ohurch should be held without
the word being preached, prayers being offered, the Lord’s
supper administered, and alms given. That this was the order
established among the Corinthiaus, may be fairly concluded
from the Epistles of Paul; and it is well known to have been
followed for many ages after. For hence those ancient canons,
which are attributed to Anacletus and Gallinas, “ that, after
the consecration is finished, all shall communicate, on pain of
expulsion from the Church.'’ And the ancient canons which
are ascribed to the apostles, say, “that those who continue not
to the end, and receive not the sacrament, ought to be cor·
rected as disturbers of the Church.’' In the Council of Antioch,
also, it was daoreed, that those who enter into the Church, hear
the sermon, and retire from the communion, be excluded from
the Church till they shall have corrected this fault. And
though in the first Council of Toledo, this decree was either
mitigated‚ orat least enacted in a milder form, yet there also
it was ordained, that those who shall be found never to com·
municate after having heard the sermon, be admonished ; and
that, if they obey not the first admonition‚ they be excom·
municated
