pastors and teachers, and thus they ordained descons. Now,
though there is no express precept for the impositiones hands,
yet since we findit to have been constantly used by the
apostles, such a punctual observande of it by them ought to
have the force of a precept with us. And certaurly this ceremony
is highly useful both to recommend to the people the dignity of
the ministry, and to admonish the person ordained that he is no
longer his own master, but devoted to the service of God and
the Ohurch. Besides, it will not be an unmeaning sign, if it be
restored to its true origin. For if the Spirit of God institutes
nothing in the Ohurch in vain, we shall pereeive that this
ceremony, which proceeded from him, is not without its use,
provided it be not perverted by a superstitious abuse. Finally,
itis to be remarked, that the impositiones hands on the minis-
ters was not the act of the whole multitude, but was confined
to the pestors. lt is not certain whether this ceremony was, in
all cases, performed by more pestors than one, or whether it
was ever the act of a single pastor. The former appears to have
been the fact in the case of the seven deacons, of Paul and Bar·
nabes, and some few others. (z) But Paul speaks of himself as
having laid hands upon Tirnothy, without any mention of many
others having united with him. “Iput thee in remembrance, that
thou stir up the gift ofGod whiehis in thee, by the putting on of
my hands.'' (a) His expression, in the other Epistle, of “the

laying on of the hands of the presbytery,'’ (b) 1 apprehend not
to signify acompany of elders, but to denote the ordination
itself3 as if he had said, Take cere that the grace which thou
receivedst hythe laying on of hands, when l ordained thee a
presbyter, be not in vain.

Hrvaaaro we have treated of the mode of govemment in
the Ohurch, as it hasbeen delivered to us by the pure word os
God, and of the offices in it, as they were instituted by Christ.
Now, that all these things may be more clearly and semiliarly
displayed, and more deeply impressed upon our minds, it will
be useful to examine what was the form of the ancient Church,
in these particulare. lt will place before our eyes an actual
