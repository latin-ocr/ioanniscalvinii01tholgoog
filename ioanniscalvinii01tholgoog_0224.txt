vidual from the unnecessary investigationes useless questions,
but think it my duty to be cautious, lest 1 encourage the vanity
of others by answering thern. Men, thirsting after useless know-
ledge, inquire what will be the distance between the prophete
and apostles, and between the apostles and martyrs3 and how
many degrees of difference there will be between those who
have married and those who have lived and died in celibacy;
in short, they leave not a corner of heaven unexplored. The
next object of their inquiry is, what end will be answered by
the restoration of the world; since the children of God will
want nothing of all its vast and incomparable abundanee, but
will be like the angels of God, whose freedom from all animal
necessities is the symbol of eternal blessedness. Ι reply, there
will be such great pleasantness in the very prospect, and such
exquisite sweetuess in the mere knowledge, without any use
of it, that this felicity will far exceed all the accommodatione
afforded us in the present state. Lat us suppose ourselves placed
in some region the most opulent in the world, and furnished
with every pleasure ς who would not sometimes be prevented
by disease from making use of the bounties of God? who
would not often have his enjoyment of them intenupted by the
consequences of intemperance? Hence it follows, that calm and
serene enjoyment, pure from every vice and free from all defect,
although there should be no use of a corruptible life, is the per·
fection of happiness. Others go further, and inquire, whether
dross and all impurities in metals are not removed from that
restoration, and incompatible with such a state. Though Ι in
some measure grant this, 1 expect, with Paul, a reparation of
all the evils caused by sin, for which he represents the creaturesas
groaning and travailing. 'I'hey proceed further still, and inquire,
what better state awaits the human race, when the blessing of
posterity shall no longer be enjoyed. The solution of this
question also is easy. 'I'he splendid commendatione of it in
the Scripturas relate to that progressive increase, by which God
is continually carrying forward the system of nature to its con-
summation. But as the unwary are easily caught by such
temptations, and are afterwards drawn further into the labyrinth,
till, at length, every one being pleased with his own opinion,
there is no end to disputes, -the best and shortest rule for our
conduct, is to content ourselves with “ seeing through a glass
darkly,” till we shall “see face to face.’' (o) For very few
persensere concamed about the way that leads to heaven, but
all are anxious to know, before the time, what passes there.
Men in general are slow, and reluctant to engage in the conflict,
and yet pertray to themselves imaginary triumphs.
