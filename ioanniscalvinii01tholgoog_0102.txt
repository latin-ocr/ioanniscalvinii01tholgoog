sallies of passion. Samson also was hurried away by similar
, fervour when he said, “0 Lord, strengthen me, that I may be
avenged of the Philistines.'’ (r) For though there was some
mixture of honest zeal, yet it was a violent, and therefore siu-
ful, avidity of revenge which predominated. God granted the
request. Whence it seems deducible, that prayers not con·
forruable to the rules of the Divine word, are nevertheless effi-
cacious. Ireply, first, thata permanent rule is not annulled by
particular examples3 secondly, that poculiar emotions have
sometimes been excitcd in a few individuale, causing a distinc-
tion between them and meniu general. For the answer of
Christ to his disciples‚ who inconsiderately wished to emulate
the example of Elias, “that they linew not what spirit they
were of,” is worthy of observation. But we must remark,
further, that God is not always pleased with the prayers which
he grente, but that, as far as examples are concerued, there are
undeuiable evidences of the Scriptura doctrine, that he suc·
cours the miserable, and hears the groans of those who under
the pressure of injustice implore his aid; that he therefore
executes his judgments, when thc complaints of the poor arise
to him, though they are unworthy of the least favourable atten-
tion. For how often, by punishing the cruelty, rapine, vio·
lenae, lust, audather crimes of the impious, by restraining
their audacity and fury, and even subverting their tyrannical
power, has he manifestly assisted the victims of unrighteous
oppression, though they have been bearing the air with suppli·
cations to an unknown God! And one of the Psalmists clearly
teaches that some prayers are not ineffectual, which neverthe·
less do not penetrate into heaven by faith. (s) For he collecta
those prayers which necessity naturally extorts from nubeliev·
ers as well as from believers, but to which the event shows
God to be propitious. Does he by such condescension testify ·
that they are acceptable to him? Νο; he designs to amplify
or illustrate his mercy by this circumstance, that even the
requests of unbolievers are not refused; and likewise to stimu-
late his true worshippers to greater diligence in prayer, while
they sce that eren the lamentations of the profane are not un·
attended with advantage. Yet there is no reason why believers
should deviate from the rule given them by God, or envy un·
believers, as though they had made some great acquisitiou when
they have obtained the object of their wishes. ln this manner
we have said that the Lord was moved by the hypocritical
penitence os Ahab, iu order to prove by this example how
ready he is to grant the prayers of his own elect, when they
sealt reconciliation with him by true conversion. Therefore in
