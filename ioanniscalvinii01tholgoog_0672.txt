constancy, for hings cannot bear to be disregarded without the
greatest indignation ; and “the wrath of ahing,” says Solomon,
“is as messengers os death.’'(l) But since this edict has

obey God rather thau men‚’' (m) -let us console ourselves with
this thought, that we tmly perform the obedience which God
requires ol us, when we suffer any thing rather than deviato
from piety. And that our hearts may not fail us, Paul stimulates
us with another consideration -that Christ has redeemed ua at
the immense price which our redemption eost him, that we may
not be submissive to tha corrupt desires os meu, much lesa be
slaves to their impiety. (a)
