will be partaker of this pollution.” 'I'o guard this most sa-
cred mystery, therefore, from being reproached‚ there is need
of great discretiou in the administrationes it, and this requires
the jurisdictiones the Church. The second end is, that the
good may not be corrupted, as is often the case, by constant
association with the wicked. For, such is our propensity to
error, nothing is more easy then for evil examples to seduce us
from rectitude of conduct. This use of discipline was re-
marked by the epostle, when he directed the Corinthians to
expel from their society e person who had been guilty of
incest. “A little leaven, '’ says he, “leaveueth the whole
lump.'’ (Ιι) And the apostle perceived such great danger
from this quarter, that he even interdicted believers from all
social intercourse with tlre wicked. “I heve written unto you,
uot to keep company, if any man that is called e brother be a
fornicator, or covetous, or an idolater, ora railer, or a drunkard,
or an extortioner3 with such a one, no, not to eat.²'(i) The
third end is, that those who are censured or excommunicated,
confounded with the sheme of their turpitude, moy be led to
repentance. Thus it is even conducive to their own benefrt
for their iniquity to be punished, that the stroke of the rod moy
arouse toa confession of their guilt, those who would only be
rendered more obstinate by indulgence. 'I'he apostle intends
the same when he ssyS, “ If any man obey not our word, note
that man, and have uo company with him, that he may be
eshamed ’³ (lc) Agein, when he says of the incestuous corin·
thien, “I have judged to deliver such e one unto Satan, that
the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord ; '' (l) thet is, as
1 understand it, thet he had consigned him toa temporal cou-
demnation, that the spirit might be eternally saved. He there·
fore calls it delivering to Satan, because the devil is without
the Church, as Christ isin the Church. For the opinion of
some persons, that it relates to a certain torment of the body
in the present life, inflicted by the ageucy of Satan, appears to
me extremely doubtful.

VI. Having stated these ends, it remeius for us to examine
how the Church exercises this branch of discipline, which
consists in jurisdiction. In the first place, let us keep in view
the distinction before mentioned, that some sins are public,
and others private, or more concealed. Public sins ere those
which are not only known to one or two witnesses, but are
committed openly, and to the scendal of the whole Church.
By private¹ sins, 1 mean, not such es are entirely unknown to
men, like those of hypocrites,—for these never come under the
cognizeuce of the Church,-butthose of an intermediate class,
