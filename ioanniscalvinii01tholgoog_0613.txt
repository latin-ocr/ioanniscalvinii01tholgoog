towards the east, then, be regarded as a sacrament? Paul says,
“l will that men pray every where, lifting up holy hands,” (lc)
and the prayers os the saints appear to have been osten made
with uplifted hands; shall elevation os hands also be made a
sacrament? On this principle all the gestures os the saints
would become sacraments. I would not insist on these things,
however, is they were not connected with those greater incon-
veniences.

lll. ll they wish to press us with the authority os the an·
cient Chnrch, 1 assert that this is a groundless pretence. For the
number os seven sacraments can nowhere be sound in the eccle·
siastical wri tera, nor is it clear when it was introduced. Igrant,
indeed, that the fathers sometimes make too free a use of the
word sacrament3 but they use it indifferently to signify all
ceremonias and external rites, and ull exercises of piety. But,
when they speak of those signs which we ought to regard aa
testimonies os the grace os God, they are content with these
two, baptism and the eucharist. That this nray not be sup-
posed to be a salse allegation,l shall herc cite a few testimonies
srom Augustine. To Januarius he says, “First,l wish you
to know what is the principal point os this controversy—
that onr Lord Jesus Ohrist, as he says in the gospel, has laid
upon us an easy yoke and a light burden. And, therefore, he
has linked together the society of the Christian Churcb by
' sacramenta, very few in number, most easy to observa, and
excellent in signification. Such are baptism, consecrated in the
name of the Trinity, andthe communiones the body and
blood os the Lord, and is there be any other enjoined in the
canonieal Scripturas.” Again, in his treatise On the Christian
Doctrine: “Since the resurrection of our Lord, our Lord
himself, and the practice of his apostles, instead of many signS,
have given us few, and those most easy in performance, most
excellent in signification, and most pure in observance; such
are baptism, and the celebration os the body and blood of the
Lord.” Why does he make no mention here of the sacred or
septenary number? ls it probable that he would have omitted
it, if it had then been instituted in the Charch, especially as,
in other cases, he was more curicus in the observation os
numbers than was at all necessary? And, when he names
baptism and the Lord's supper, and is silent respecting any
others, does he not sufficiently indicate, that these two mysteries
possess superior and peculiar dignity, and that all other cere·

’ monies oceupy an inferior station? Wherefore l affirm that

these advocates for seven sacraments are not only unsnpported
by the word os the Lord, but also by the consent os the ancient

(r) irim. aa.
