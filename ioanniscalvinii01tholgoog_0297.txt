benefice without any indirect recommendation. Some ere pro·
moted by relationship‚ others by alliance, others by the influence
of parents, others gain favour by their services. ln short, the
end for which sacerdotal offices are conferred, is not to provide
for the ChurcheS, but for the persons to whom they are given.
And therefore they call them benefices, a name by which they
sufficiently declare that they view them in no other light than
as donatives of princes, by which they either conciliate the
favour of their soldiers, or reward their services. l sorbeat
to remark that these rewards are conferred upon hecbere, coolts,
mrrleteerS, and other dregs of the people, And, in the present
day, scarcely any litigatione make more noise in the courts of
justice than those respecting benefiees; so that they may be
considered as amere prey thrown out for dogs to hunt after.
ls it tolerable even to hear the name of pastore given to men
who have forced themselves into the possession of a Church, as
into an enemy's farm ; who have obtained it by alegal process;
who have purchased it with money; who have gained it
by dishonourable services; who, while infanta just beginning
to lisp, succeeded to it as an inheritancc transmitted by their
uncles and cousins, and sometimes even by fathers to their il·
legitimate children?

Vll. Would the licentiousness of the people, however corrupt
and lawless, ever have proceeded to such a length? But it is
still more monstrous that one man -Ι say nothing of his qualifi-
cations, only a man not capable of governing himself- should
preside over the government of five or six Ohurches. We
may now see, in the courts of princes, young men who hold
one archbishopric, two bishoprics‚ and three abbeys. lt is
a common thing for canons to be loaded with five, six, or
seven benefices, of which they take not the least care, except
in receiving the revenues. Ι will not object that this is every
where condemned by the word of God, which has long ceased
to have the least weight with them. Ι will not object tha.
various oouncils have made many very severe decrees against
such disorder; for these also, whenever they please, they feer-
lessly treat with contempt. But Ι maintain, that both these
things are execrable enorrnities, utterly repugnant to God, to
nature, and to the government of the Ohurch—that one robber
should engross several Charches at once, and that the name
of pastor should be given to one who could not be present
with his doch, even if he would ; and yet, such is their impu-
denee, they cover these abominable impurities with the name
of the Church, in order to exempt thern from all censure. And,
nroreover, that inviolable succession, to the merit of which they
boast that the Church owes its perpetual preservation, is in·
eluded in these iniquities.
