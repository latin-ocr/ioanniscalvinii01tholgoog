or that every dove is the Holy Spirit, because he appeared
under that form. But let them look to these things. For us,
it is sufficient, at present, that we see beyond all doubt that
their unction is not a sacrament, being a ceremony which is
neither of God’s institution, nor accompanied with any promise
from him. For when we require these two things in a sacra·
ment, that it be a ceremoay instituted by God, aad that it have
some promise of God, we attha same time require that the
ceremony be enjoined upon us, and that the promise have re·
ference to us. For no one contends that circumcision is now
a sacrament of the Christian Charch, notwithstanding it was
instituted by God, and had a promise annexed to it; because
it is not enjoined upon us, noris the promise which was sub-
joiued to it given to us on that condition. That the promise
which they presumptuously boast os in their unction is not
given to us, we have clearly proved, and they themselves
declara by experience. Tha ceremoay ought not to have been
used, except by those who were endued with the gift of heal-
ing, and not by these butchers, who are more capable ol
hilling and murdering than os healing.

XXI. Even it they had established, what they are very far
from having established, that the injunction ol James respect-
ing unction is applicable to the present age, still they would
have made but little progress in desending their unction with
which they have hitherto besmeared us James directs that all
sick persons be anointed; these men bedaub with their unguent
not sick persons, but half-dead corpses, when their souls areat
the point of departing from them. lf in their sacrament they
have a present medicine, by which they cau either alleviata
the anguish of disease, or at least communicate some consola·
tion to the soul, they are cruel never to apply the remedy in
time. James directs, that the sich person be anointed by the
elders of the Church3 these men admit no anointer but a priest.
Their explanation that the term chiara denotas priests, and
the plural number is used sor the sake ol dignity‚ is irivolous
in the extreme; as though the Charches in that age abounded
with priests, to be able to march in along processioa, carrying
their box ol consecrated oil. When James simply commanda
that sick persons be anointed, he appears to me to intend no
other unction than os common oil ; nor is any other mentioned
in the narrative os Mark. These men deign to use no oil
which hasnot been consecrated bythe bishop; that is, warmed
with his breath, enchanted by his muttering, and nine times
saluted by him on bended lmees; three times, Hail, hely cil ,·
three times, Hail, hely ebriam, three times, Hail, helymam.
From whom have they derived such incantatione? James
says, that when the elders shall have prayed over the siclt
