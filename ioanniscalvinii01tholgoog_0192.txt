vered by him iuto his protection. (m) If, therefore, we want
to ascertain whether God is concerned for our salvation, let us iu·
quire whether he has committed us to Christ, whom he constitut·
ed the only Saviour of all his people. Now, if we doubt whether
Christ has received us into his charge and custody, he obviates
this doubt, by freely offering himself as our Shepherd, and declar·
ing that if we hear his voice, we shall be numbered among his
sheep. We therefore embraee Christ, thus kindly offered to us
and advancing to meet us3 and he will number us with his
sheep, and preservans enclosed in his sold. But yet wc feel
anxiety for our future state; for as Paul declares that “whom
he predestinated, them he also callod,” (n) so Christ informs
us that “many are called, but few chosea.''(o) BesideS,
Paul himself 1110, iu another place, cautious against carelessness,
saying, “ Let him that thinketh he standeth, take heed lest he
fall.’' (p) Again: “Art thou grafted among the people of God?
Bo not high-minded, but fear. God is able to cut thee off again,
and graft in others.''(q) Lastly, experienee itself teaches us
'that vocation and faith are of little valae, unless accompaniod
by perseverance, which is not the lot of all. But Christ has
delivered us from this anxiety, for these promises undoubtedly
belong to the future: “ All that the Father giveth me, shall
come to me; and him that cometh to me,l will inno wise
cast out. And thia is the Father's will which hath sent me,
that of all which he hath given me, I should lose nothing,
but should saise it up again at the last day.'’ (r) Again: “ My
sheep hear my voice, andI know them, and they follow me.
And l give nnto them eternal life, and they shall never perish,
neither shall any pluck thom out of my hand. My Father,
which gave them me, is greater than all; and none is able
to pluck them out of my Pother’s hand.'' (s) Resides, when
he declares, “Every plant which my heavenly Father hath
not planted, shall be rooted up,”(t) he fully implies on the
contrary, that those who are rooted in God, can never by any
violence be deprived of salvation. With this corresponds
that passage of John, “If they had been of us, they would no
doubt have continued with us.'’ (a) Hence also that magnifi-
cent exultation of Paul, iu defiauce of lifc and death, of things
present and future3 which must necessarily have been founded
in the gift of perseverasse. (a) Nor ean it be doubted that ho
applies this sentiment to all the elect. rl'he same apostle in
another place says, “He which hath begua a gopd work in
you, will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ’ ²(y) This
