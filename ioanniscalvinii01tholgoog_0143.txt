this, God may, when he sees fit, deliver us to Satan, abandon
us to a reprobate mind and sordid passione, and so lead us into
temptatione, by a righteous yet often secret judgment3 the
cause being frequently coneeeled from man, but, at the same
tIme, well known to him. Whence it is inferred, that there is
no impropriety in this mode of expression, if we are persuaded
that there is any meaning in his frequent threatenings, that he
will manifest his vengeance on the reprobate, by smitmg them
with blindness and hardness of heart.

XLVII. These three petitione, in which we particularly corn·
mend to God ourselves and all our concerns, evidently prove,
what we have before asserted, that the prayers of Christiana
ought to be public, and to regard the public edification of
the Ghurch, and the advancement of the communion ot⁴ be·
lievers. For each individual does not supplicate the gift of
any favour to himself in particular; but we all in common
pray for our breed, the remissiori ot⁴ our sins, that we may not
be led into temptation, that we may be delivered from evil.
'I'he cause is likewise subjoined, which gives us such great

’ boldness in asking, andconfidence of obtelning3 which, though

not to be found in the Latin copies, yet appears too apposite to
this place to be omitted-namely, Hrs rs ιιι ιιιοιοιι, ιιι
ιιι rowsa, asu> rrrrr sacar roa evea. This is a solid and
secure basis for our faith3 for if our prayers were ιο be recom-
mended to God by our own merit, who could dare to utter a
word in his presence? Now, all miserable, unworthy, and
destitute as we ιιι ot⁴ every recommendatmn, yet we shall
never want an argument οι plea for our prayers: our confi·
dence can never forsake us3 for our I'ather can never be de-

prived of his kingdom, power, and glory. 'Phe whole is con·
cluded with Αιιιις which expresses our ardent desire to obtaIn
the blessings supplicated of God, and confirms our hope that
all these things are already obtained, and will certainly be
granted ιο us3 because they are promised by God, who is in·
capable of deception. And this agrees with that form of peti·
tion already quoted-“ Do this, Ο Lord, for thy name’s sake,
not for our sake, or for our righteousness ; ” in which tho saints
not only express the end of their prayers, but acknowledge that
they are unworthy to obtain it, unless God derive the cause
from himself, and that their confidence of success arises solely
from his nature.

XLVIII. Whatever we ought, or are even at liberty, to
seek from God, is stated to us in this model and directory for
prayer, given by that best of masters, Christ, whom the Father
has set over us as our Teaeher‚ and to whom alone he has en·
joined us to liston. (b) For he was always his eternal wisdom,
