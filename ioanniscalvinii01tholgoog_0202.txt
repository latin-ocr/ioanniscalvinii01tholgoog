ceive the favour? Hence we perceive it ιο ιο a violent per·
version of the passage, if the will of God, mentioned by tha
prophet, be set in opposition ιο his eremal ananeel, by which
he has distinguished the elect from the reprobate. Now, is we
inquire the genuine sense of the prophet, his only meaning is
ιο inspira the penitent with hopes of pardon. And this is the
sum, that it ia beyond a doubt that God is ready to pardon sin·
ners immediately on their conversion. Therefore he wills not
their death, inasmuch as he wills their repentance. But expo·
rienca teaches, that he does not will the repentauce of those
whom he extemally calls, in such a manner as to affect all their
hearts. Nor should he on this account be charged with acting
deceitfully; sor, though his external call only renders those Ι
who hear without obeying it inexcusable, yet it is justly es·
teemed the testimony of God’s grace, by which he reconciles
men to himself. Let us observa, therefore, the design of tho
prophet in saying that God has no pleasure in the death of a
sinner3 it is to assare the picus of God's readiness ιο pardon
thern immediately on their repentance, aud to show the impious
the aggravation of their sin in rejecting such great compassion
and kindness of God. Repentance, therefore, will always ba
met by Divina mercy3 but on whom repentance is bestowed,
we are clearly taught by Ezekiel himself, as well as by all the
propheta and apostles.

XVI. Another passage adduced is from Paul, where he states
that “God will have all men to be saved 3 ’² (o) which, though
somewhat different from the passage just considered, yet is very
similar ιο it. Ireply, in the first place, that it is evident from
the context, how God wills the salvation of all; for Paul con·
nects these two things together, that he “will have all men to
be saved, and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.'’ lf
it was fixed in the eternal cotmsel of God, that they should
receive the doctrine of salvation, what is the meaning of that
question of Moses, “ What nationis there so grcat, who hath God
so niglr unto them as we have 1 ” (p) How is it that God has
deprived many nations of the light of the gospel, which others
enjoyed? How is it that the pure knowledge of the doctrine
of piety has never reached some, and that others have but just
heard some obscure rudimenta of it? Hence it will be easy to
discover the design of Paul. He had enjoined Timothy to
make solemn prayers in the Church for kings and princes ; but
as it might seem somewhat inconsistent ιο pray to God for
a class of men almost past hope-for they vvere not only
strangers ιο the body of Christ, but striving with all their pow-
er ιο ruin his kingdom, -he subjoins, that “this is good and
