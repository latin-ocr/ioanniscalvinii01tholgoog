CHAPTER xxlt.

reseruemus 01* SCRIPTUM IN ΟΟΝΠΜΔΤΙΟΝ 01· ants socnam.

Aac the positione we have advanced are controverted by ma·
ny, especially the gratuitous electiori of believers, which never-
theless cannot be shaken. lt is a notion commonly entertained,
that God, foreseeing what would be the respective merits of
every individual, makes a correspondent distinction between
different persons3 that he adopts as his children such as he
foreknows will be deserving of his grace, and devotas to the
damnation of death others, whose dispositions he sees will be
inclined to wickedness and impiety. Thus they not only
obscure electiori by covering it with the veil of sorelmow·
ledge, but pretend that it originates in another cause. Nor is
this commonly received notion the opiniones the vulgar only,
for it has had great advocates in all ages; which 1 candidly
confess, that no one may cherish a confidence of injuring our
cause by opposing us with their names. For the tmth os God
on this point istoc cenain to be shaken, too clear to be over·
thrown bytho authority of men. Others, neither acquainted
with the Scriptum, nor deserving of any attention, oppose the
sound doctrine with extreme presumption and intolerable es·
frontery. God’s sovereign electiori of some, and preterition of
others, they make the subject os fonnal accusation against
him. But if thiais the known fact, what will they gain by
quarrelling with Godl We teach nothing but what experience
has proved, that God has always been at liberty to bestow his
grace on whom he chooses. I will not inquire how the pos·
terity of Abraham excelled other nations, unless it was by that
favour, the cause os which can only be found in God. Let them
answer why they are men, and not oxen orasses: when it was
, in God’s power to create them dogs, he fonned them after his

acquired by no merits,is certainly no more reasonable than
