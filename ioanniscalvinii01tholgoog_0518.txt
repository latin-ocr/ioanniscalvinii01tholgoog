from tlte womb denotas from childbood. But it is easy to see
that, in the declaration of the angel to Zacharias, it was used
in a different sense, and that John was to be filled with the
Holy Spirit, even before he was born. (c) Lct us not attempt,
therefore, to impose laws upon God, whose power has sustained

no diminution, but who is able to sanctify whom he pleases, ,

as he sanctified this child.

XVlll. And for this reason, Christ was sanctified from his
earliest infancy, that he might sanctify in himself all his elect,
of every age, without any difference. For as, in order to ob-
literate the gnilt of the transgression which had been perpe-
trated in our flesh, he assumed to himself that very flesh, that
he might perform a perfect obediencc in it, on our account,
and in our stead‚ so he was conceived of the Holy Spirit,
that, having the whole body which he assumed, fully endued
with the sanctity of the Spirit, hc might communicate the
same to ns. If Christ exhibita a perfect exemplar of all the
greces which God bestows npon his children, he will also
furnish us with a proof, that tha age of infancy is not al-
together incompatible with sanctification. But, however this
may be, we consider it as clear, beyond all controversy, that
not one of the elect is called out of the present life, with·
out having been previously regenerated and sanctified by the
Spirit of God. 'l'heir objection, that the Holy Spirit, in the
Scripturas, acknowledges no regeneration, except from “the
incorruptible seed,'’ that is, “the word of God,” (d) is a mis·
interpretation of that passage of Peter, which merely compre·
hends believers who hadbsen taught by the preaching of the
gospel. 'Po such persons, indeed, we grant that the word of
the Lord is the only seed of spiritual regeneration; but we
deny that it ought to be concluded from this, that infanta can-
not be regeneratcd by the power of God, which is as easy to
him as itis wonderful and mysterious to us. Besides, it would
not be safe to affirm, that the Lord cannot reveal himself iu
any way >so as to make himself known to them.

XIX. But our opponente say, “Paith cometh by hear-
ing,’' (e) of which they have not yet acquired the use, and
they cannot be capable of knowing God; for Moses declares
them to “have no knowledge between good and evil.’' (s)
But they do not consider, that when tho apostle rnalres hearing
‚the source of faith, he only describes the ordinary economy
aud dispensation of the Lord, which he generally observes in
the calling of his people3 but does not prescribe a perpetual
rulc for him, precluding his employment of any other method;
which he has certainly employed in the calling of many, to
