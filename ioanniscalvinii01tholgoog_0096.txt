he very aptly expresses its nature. And equally worthy 01
011001100 10 what he adds, that they 01011 nothing, who call
upon God in perplexity and doubt, and are uncertain in their
minds whether they shall be heard or not ; whom he eveu com·
pares to waves, which are variously tossed and driven about with
the wind. Whence he elsewhere calls 0 legitimate prayer “ the
prayer 01 101111.” (n) Besides, when God so frequently 01111101,
that he will give to every man according to his saith, he implies
that we can obtain nothing without 101111. Fiually, it is saith
that obtaius whatever is granted in answer to prayer. 'I'his is
the meaning 01 11101 1010000 passage 01 Ρο01, 10 which injudi-

whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in
him, 01 whom they have not heard? So then saith cometh by
hearing, and hearing by the word 01 God.'' (o) For by 0 re·

those to whom his clemency and gentleness have been revealed

they consider us as advauciug the greatest 01 011 absurdities.
But 11 they were in the habit 01 1100 prayer, they would cer-

learned by prayer, aud he who does 001 perceive this, betrays
