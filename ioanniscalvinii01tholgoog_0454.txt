Christiana, some ure called Benedictines, others Francisenns,
others Dominieans; and when they heughtily assume these
titles to themselves es the badges of their religious profession,
from sn nffectation of being distinguished from the general
body uf Christiane.

XV. The differenees which 1 have stated, between the nu-
eient moniis end those of the present age, relate not to manners,
but to the profession itself. Let it, therefore, be rernembered by
the readers, thet 1 have spoken os monaehism rather than uf
monlrs, und have censured those fsults which ore not merely
chargeshle un the lives of ιι few, but whieh ore insepnrehle
from the life itsels. The great dissimilnrity os their manners
can hardly require ι particular representation. lt is obvious,
that thero is no order os men more pollute-i with all the turpi-
tude of viee ; none more disgraoed by sections, animosities,
cubula, md intriguesi ln some few convents, indeed, they live
in annatim if ehsstity it must be called, where eoncupiscenoe
is so ser restrained es not to be publiely infemous, but it is
soucoly possible to find one convent in ten, which is not
rather s brothel thm u sanetuery of chastity. What frugality
is there in their foed? They are exeetly like so many swine
fattening in a styi But lest they should eomplsin thst 1
handle thern too roughly, 1 proeesd no further, though in the
few portienlors upon which 1 have touched, whoever knuws
the mutter of feet will unknowledgo that 1 heve confined my-
self to the simple truth. Angustine, at u time when, secord-
ing to his own testimony, monks were so eminent for the
ntrictest chustity, yet complains that there were many vagn-
bonds among thern, who, by wicked srts end impostures, ex-
torted money from the unwsry, who exereised a soandslons
treffie by carrying about the relies of martyre, und even sold
the bones of any dead men ss the bones of martyrs, end who
brought disgrsee ou the order by n great number of similar
crimes. As hs declares that he hed seen no better men then
those who had been improved in monssteries, so lie complains
that he hsd seen no worse men then those who hed been eor-
rupted in monasterias. What would he say, nt the present day,
to see almo-t all monasterius, not only filled, but ovexfiowing,
with so many und such desperate vices? lsey nothing but what
is notorious to every pen-om though this censura is uot appli-
eable to all without my exception. For ss the rule end ‹lisci-
pline of holy living hes never been so well established in mon-
asteries, but that there were always some drones very different
from the rest, so 1 do not say thst the monks of the present
dsy heve so sar degenerare-1 from thot holy antiquitysffligh-
are not still some good meu among their ·
