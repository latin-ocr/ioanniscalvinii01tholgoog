Church, however they may boast of such consent. Let us now
proceed to the particular ceremonies.

communion.

IV. It was an ancient custom in the Ghurch for the children
of Christiane, after they were come to years of discretiori, to be
presented to the bishop in order to fulfil that duty which was
required of adults who offered themselves to baptism. For
such persons were placed among the catechumene, till, being
dnly instructed iu the mysteries of Christianity, they were
enabled to make a confession of their saith before· the bishop
and all the people. Theresore those who had been baptized
in their infancy, because they had not then made such a con·
fession of saith before the Chumh, at the close of childhood, or
the commencement of adolescencc, were again presented by their
parents, and were examined by the bishop according to the form
of the catechism which was then iu common use. That this
exercise‚ which deserved to bc regarded as sacred and solemn,
might have the greater dignity and reverence, they also practised
the ceremony of imposition of hands. Thus the youth, aster
having given satisfaction respecting his saith, was dismissed
witha solemn benediction. This custom is frequently men·
tioned by the ancient writers. Len, the pope, says, “If any
one be converted from heresy, let him not be baptized again 3
but let the influence os the spirit, which he wanted among the
hereticS, be communicated to him by the impositiones the
hands of the bishop.” Here our adversaries will exclaim that
any ceremony,>by which the Holy Spirit is conserred, is pro·
perly denominated a sacrament. But the meaning of Leo in
these words is sufficiently unfolded by himself iu another
place: “Whoever is baptized among heretics, let him not
be rebaptized3 but let him be confirmed by imposition of
hands with invocation of the Holy Spirit3 because he has
received the mere form of baptism, without the sanctification.’'
It is also mentioned by Jerome against the Luciferians. And
though 1 confess that Jerome is not altogether correct iu
stating it to have been a custom of the apostles, yet he is very
sar from the absurdities now maintained by the Romanists;
and he even corrects that very statement by adding, that this
benediction was committed wholly to the bishops, “rather in
honour of the priesthood than from necessity imposed by any
law.'' Such imposition of hands, therefore, as is simply con·
nected with benediction,l highly approve, and wish it were
now restored to its primitive use, uncorrupted by superstition.
