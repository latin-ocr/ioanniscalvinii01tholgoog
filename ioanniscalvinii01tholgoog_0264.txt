nalasarenunciation of God. And certainly, if those assemblies
were Churohes, it follows that Elijah, Micaiah, and others in
Israel, were strangers to the Church of God, and the same
would be true of lsaiah, Jeremiah, Hosea, and others of that
description in Judah, whom the false prophets, priests, and people
of their day, hated aod execrated as if they had been worse than
any heathens. If such assemblies were Churohes, then the
Church is not the pillar of nuth, but a foundation of falsehood,
not the sanctuary of the living God, but a receptacle of idola.
They found themselves under a necessity, therefore, of with·
drawing from all connection with those assemblies, which were
nothing but a conspiracy against God. For the same reason,
if any one acknowledges the assemblies of the present day,
which are contaminated with idolatry, superstition, and false
doctrine, as true Churohes, in full communion with which a
Christian man ought to continue, and in whose doctrine he ought
to coincide, this will be a great error. For if they be Churohes,
they possess the power of the keys; but the heys are insepa-
rably connected with the word, which is exploded from among
them. Again, if they be Churches, that promise of Christ must
be applicable to them-“ Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth
shall be bound in heaven, and whatsoever ye shall loose on
earth shall he loosed in heaven.” (a) On the contrary, all who
sincerely profess themselves to be the servants of Christ, they
expel from their communion. Bither, therefore, the promise
of Christ must be vain, or in this respect they are not
Churohes Lastly, instead of the ministry of the word, they
have achools of impiety, and egulf of every species of errore.
Either, therefore, in this respect they are not Churohes, or no
mark will be left to distinguish the legitimate assemblies of
believers from the conventione of Turks.

XL Nevertheless, as in former times the Jews continued in
possession of some peculias privileges of the Church, so we
refusa not to acknowledge, among the Papists of the present
day, those vestiges of the Church which it has pleased the Lord
should remain among them after its removal. When God had
once made his covenant with the Jews, it continued among
thern, rather because it was supported by its own stability
in opposition to their impiety, than in consequence of their
observance of it. Such, therefore, was the certainty and con-
stancy of the Divino goodness, the covenant of the Lord
remained among them; his faithfulncss could not be obliterated
by their perfidy ; nor could circumcision be so profaned by their
impure hands, but that it was always the true sign and sacra- ’
ment of his covenant. Hence the children that were born
