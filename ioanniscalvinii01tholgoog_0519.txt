whom he has given the true knowledge of himself in an inter·
nal manner, by the illumination of his spirit, without the
intervention of any preaching. But as they think it would be
such a great absurdity for any knowledge of God to be given
to infants, to whom Moses denies the knowledge of good and
evil, l would beg them to inform me, what danger can result from
our affirming that they already receive some portion of that
grace, of which they will ere long enjoy the full abnndance.
For if the plenitude of life consisto in the perfect knowledge
of God, -when some of them, whom death removes from the
present state in their earliest infancy, pass into eternal life,
they are certainly admitted to the immediate contemplationes
the presence of God. As the Lord, therefore, will illuminate
thern with the full splendour of his countenance in heaven,
why may he not also, if such be his pleasure, irradiata them
with som'e faint rays os it in the present life3 especially if he
does not deliver them from all ignorance before he liberates
tham from the prison of the body? Not that Ι would hastily
affirm them to be endued with the same faith which we expe·
rience in ourselves, or at all to possess a similar knowledge of
faith, which Ι would prefer leaving in suspense; my design is
only to check their foolish arrogance, who presumptuously as·
sert or deny whatever they please.

XX. To strengthen their cause still further, our opponente
proceed to allege, that baptism is a sacrament of repentance
and saith; and that, therefore, as neither of these can be exer·
cised in infancy, infants ought not to be admitted toa partici-
pation of baptism, the signification of which would thereby
be rendered vain. But these arguments are directed against
God, more than against us. For it is very evident, from many
testimonias of Scriptura, that circumcision also was a sign of
ratu nutu lharlelalukaurul
why he commanded it tob’e impfessed on the bodies of infantsf
For, as baptism and circumcision both stand on the same
ground, they can attribute nothing to the latter which they
must not also grant to the former. If they recur to their
favourite subterfuge, that the age of infancy then prefigured
spiritual infants, it hasbeen already answered. We say, there·
fore, that since God formerly communicated to infants the rite
of circumcision, which was a sacrament of repentance and
faith, it appears to be no absurdity for tham now to bc admitted
to a participation of baptism, unless these men wish to offer a
direct insult to the institution of God. But in this, as wellas
in all the proceedings os God, his wisdom and righteousness
