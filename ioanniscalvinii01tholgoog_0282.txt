bishop to abstain from preaching. Gregory somewhere says,
“A priest dies, if his sound be not heard ; (d) for he provokes
the wrath of the invisible Judge against him, if he go without
the sound of preaching.” And in another place: “When Paul
declares that he is ‘pure from the blood os all,' (e) by this decla·
ration, we, who are called priests, are convicted, confounded,
and declared to be guilty, who to all our own crimes add the
deaths of others; for we are chargeable with slaying all those
whom we daily behold advaucing to death, while we are indif-
ferent and silent.” He calls himself and others silent, because
they were less assiduous in their work thau they ought to be.
Since he spares not those who performed half of their duty, what
is it probable he would have done, if any one had neglected it
altogether? It was therefore long maintained in the Church,
that the principal office of a bishop was to seed the people with
the word of God, or to cdify the Church both in public and
private with sound doctrine.

IV. The establishment of one archbishop over all the bishops
of each province, and the appointment of patriarcha at the
Council of Nice, with rank and dignity superior to the arch·
bishopS, were regulations for the preservation of discipline. ln
this disquisition, however, what was of the least frequent use
cannot be wholly omitted. 'Phe principa} reason, therefore, for
the institution of these orders was, thatif any thing should
take place in any Ohurch which could not be settled hy a few
persons, it might be referred to a provincial synod. lf the
magnitude or difficulty of the case required a further discussion,
the patriarcha were called to unite with the, synods; and from
them there could be no appeal but to a general council. This
constitution of government some called a hierarcby- a name, iu
my opinion, improper, and certainly not used in the Scripturas.
For it has been the design of the Holy Spirit, iu every thing
relating to the govemment of the Ghurch, to guard against
any dreams of principality or dominion. But is we loolt at the
thing, without regarding the term, we shall find that the an·
cient bishops had no intention of contriving a formos govem·
ment for the Ghurch, different from that which God has pre-
scribed in his word.

V. Nor was the situation of deacons at that time at all dif-
ferent from what it had been under the apostles. For they
received the daily contributions of believers and the annual
revenues of the Ohurch, to apply them to their proper uses,
that is, to distribute part to the ministare, and part for the sup·
port of the poor; subject, however, to the authority of the
bishop, to whom they also rendered an account of their admi·
