piety, to the study of which Jesus Christ commanda his ser·
vante constantly to devote themselves, our present monlrs ima·
gine l know not what new kind of piety, in the meditatiou of
which they are become more perfect than all others.

XI. lfthey deny this, l would wish them to inform me
why they dignify their order alone with the title of perfectiore, -
aud deny this characterto all the calliugs appointed by God. I
am not unacquainted with their sophistica! solution, that itis
so called, not as containing perfectiori iu it, but because it is
the best calculated of all callings for the attaiument of perfec·
tion. When they wish to elevate themselves in the estimatiou
of the people‚ to entrap inexperienced and ignorant youths, to
essert their privileges, to extol their own dignity to the dc-
gradation ol others, they boast of being in a state of perfee-
tion. When they are so closely presscd, that they cannot
defend such empty arrogance, they have recourse to this sub·
terfuge—that they have not yet attaiued perfectiori, but that
they are in a condition more savourable than any others ι
for aspiriug towards it. ln the mean time they retain the
admiration of the people‚ as though the monastic life, and
that alone, were angclic, perfect, aud purified from every
blemish. Under this pretext they carry on a most lucrative
traffic; but their moderatiori lies buried in a few books. Who
does not see that this is an intolerable mockery? But lot us
argue the case as if they really attributed no higher honour to
their profession, than to call it a state adopted to the attainment
of perfectiori. Still, by giving it this designatiou, they dis·
tinguish it, as by a peculiar marlr, from all other modes of life.
And who can bear that such honour should be transferred to
au institution, which has never received from God evena single
syllable of approbation‚ and that such indiguity should be cast
on all the other callings of God, which have not only been
enjoined, but adorned with signal commendatione by his most
holy word? And what an outrageous iusult is offered to God,
when a mere human invention is preferred beyond all the lriude
of life which he has appointed and celebrated by his own
testimony!

Xll. NoW, let them charge me with a calumuy iu whatl
have already alleged, that they are not content with the rule
which God has prescribed to bis servants. 'Phough I were
silent on the subject, they furnish more than sufficient ground
for their own accusation3 for they openly teech that they
take upon themselves a greater burden than Christ laid upou
his disciples, because they promise to lreep the evangelieal
counsels‚ which inculcata the love of our enemies, and pro·
