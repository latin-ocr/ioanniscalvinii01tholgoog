attempts os that impious men, restored peace to the Churches
which he had disturbed‚ and asserted the eternal deity os Christ
in opposition to his sacrilegious dogma Some time alter. when
Eunomius and Macedonius raised new contentione, their frenzy
was opposed with a similar remedy by tlrc Council ot' Constanti·
nople. The impiety os Nestorius was condemned iu the first
Council ol Ephesus. In short, this has been the ordinary method
os the Church from the beginning, sor the preservatiou of uuity, ,
wheuever Satan has begun to make any attempt against it.
But let it be remembered, that neither every age, nor every
place, can produce an Athanasius a Basil, a Cyni, and other such
champious os the true doctrine, as the Lord raised up at those
periods. Let it also be recollected what happened at the
second Council of Ephesus, in which the heresy of Eutyches
prevailcd. Flavianus, a bishop of irreproachable memory, was
banished, together with other pious men, and many similar
enormities were committed, because it was Dioscorus, asactious
and ill-disposed man, and not the Spirit of the Lord, that presided
in that council. But that council‚ it will he said, was not the
Ohurch. l admit it: for lam firmly persuaded of this, that the
truth is not extinct in the Ghurch, though it may be oppressed by
one council, but that it is wonderfully preserved bytho Lord, to
arise and triumph again iu his own time. But l deny it to be
an invariable rule, that every interpretation which may bave
been approved bya council is the true and certain sense of
the Scri ture.

xlv. pBut the Romanists have a further design in maintain-
ing that couucils possess the power os interpreting the Scriptura,
and that without appeal. For it is a false pretence, when every
thing that hasbeen determined in councils is called an inter-
pretation os the Scriptura Of purgatory, the intercession os
saints, auricular confession, and similar fooleries, the Scripturas
contain not a single syllable. But, because all these things
have been sanctioned by the authority of councils, or, to speak
more correctly, have been admitted into the general belief and
practice, therefore every one os themis to be taken sor an in·
terpretation of Scripture. And not only s0; but is a council
t determine in direct oppositiou to the scripture, it will still be
called an interpretation of it. Christ commands all to drink os
the cup which he presents to thern iu the sacred supper. (c)
'I'he Council os Constance prohibited it to be given to the
laity, and determined that none but the priest should drinlr os
it. Yet this, which isso diametricallyrepugnant to the institu-
tion οἰ Christ, they wish usto receive as an interpretation οἱ it.
Paul calls “forbiddiug to marry'’ a “doctrine os devils;” (d)

(c) Men. xxvi. vt. (d) l Tim. iv. 1, 3.
