follow the admonition ol' Paul, and consider the measure os
grace which he has received. (b) My only meaning here,
therefore, is, that vows ought to be regulated by that measure
which the Lord prescribes to us, by what he has given us; lest,
by attempting more than he perrnits, we precipitato ourselves

into danger, by arrogating too much to ourselves. Luke gives
us an example in those assassins who vowed “that they would
neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul ε ” (c) even though
the design itself had not been criminal, yet it would have be·
trayed intolerable rashnesS, to make a man’s lise and death
subject to their power. So Jephthah suffered the punishment
of his fully, when, in the fervonr of precipitation, he made an
inconsiderate vow. (d) ln vows of this class, distinguished
by mad presumption, that of celibacy holds the predminence.
Priests‚ monks, and nuns, forgetting their infirmity, think thern·
selves capable of celibacy. But by what revelation have they
been taught that they shall preserve their chastity all their life·
time, to the end of which their vow reaches? They hear the
declaration os God concerning the universal condition os man;
“lt is not good sor man to be alone.'' (e) They understand,
and I wish they did not secl, that sin remaining inus is attended
with the most powerful stimulants. With what confidence
can they dare to reject that general calling sor their whole
life-time, whereas the gilt os continence is frequently bestowed
sor a certain time, as opportunity requires? ln such obstinacy
let them not expect God to assist them, but rather let them
remember what is written: “Thou shalt not tempt the Lord
thy God.’‘ (s) Now, it is tempting God, to strive against the
nature which he has implanted in us, and to despise the. gista
which he presents, as though they were not at all suitable for
us. And they not only do this, but even marriage itscls,
which God has deemed it no degradation os his majesty to
institute, which he has pronounced to be “ hononrable in all‚’¹
which our Lord Jesus Christ sanctified with his presence,
which he deigned to dignify with his first mirante, they are
not ashamed to stigmatize as pollution‚ sor the mere purpose
ol' extolling celibacy, however it may be spent, with the most
extravagant encomiums. As though they did not exhibita
striking proof in their own lives, that celibacy is one thing, arrd
that virginity is another; and yet they have the consummate
impudence to call such a life angelic. 'l'his is certainly doing
a great injury to the angels os God, to whom they compare
persons guilty of fomicntion, adultery, and other crimes far mora
atrocious and impure. And there is not the least need os argu-
ments, when they are clearly convieted by the lact itali.. Fu
