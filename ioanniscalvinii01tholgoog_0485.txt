“according tobis mercy he saved us, by the washing os regene-
ration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost 3 '' (v) and by Peter,
that “baptism doth save us.'’ (ro) For it was not the intention
os Paul to signify that our ablution and salvation are completed
by the water, or that water contains in itself the virtue to puri·
t'y, regenerata, and renew; nor did Peter mean that it was the
cause os salvation, but only that the knowledge and assurance
of it is received in this sacrament; which is sufficiently evident
from the words they have used. For Paul connects together the
“word os lise” aud “the baptism of water ; ” asis he had said
that our ablution and sanctification are announced to us by the
gospel, and by baptism this message is confirmed. And Peter,
after having said that “baptism dothsave uS,’' immediately adds
that it is ‘⁴ not the putting away of the filth ol' the flesh, but the
answer os a good conscience towards God,'' which proceeds
from saith. But, on the contrary, baptism promises us no other
purification than by the sprinkling os the blood os Christ3
which is emblematically represented by water, on account of
its resemblance to washing and cleansing. Who, then, can
pretend that we are cleansed by that water, which clearly testi·
fies the blood os Christ to be our true and only ablutioni So
that, to refuta the errores those who refer all to the virtue of
the water, no better argument could be found, than in the signi-
fication of baptism itself, which abstracts us, as well from that
visible clement which is placed before our eyeS, as from all
other means of salvation, that it may fix our minds ou Christ
alone.

lll. Nor must it be supposed that baptism is administered
only for the time past, so that sor sins into which we sall aster
baptism it would be necessary to scel( other new remedies of
expiation in l know not what other sacramentaria if the virtue
os baptism were become obsoleta. ln consequence of this error,
it happened, in former ages, that some persons would not be bap·
tized except at the close os their lise, and almost in the moment
of their death, that so they might obtain pardon for their whole
lise- a preposterous caution, which is frequently censured in
the writings of the ancient bishops. But we ought to conclude,
that at whatever time we are baptized, we are washed and
purified sor the whole of life. Whenever we have fallen, there·
fore, we must recur to the remembrance os baptism, and arm
our minds with the consideration of it, that we may be always
certified and assured os the remission os our sins. For though,
when it has been once administered, it appears to be past, yet
it is not abolished by subsequam sins. For the purity of
Christ is offered to us in it; and that always retains its virtue,
