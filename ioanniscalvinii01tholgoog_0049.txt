that we are justified neither without faith, nor by saith alon03
and that our righteousness iscompleted by works. Therefore
lcoujure belierers, if they know that the true rule of righteous·
neseis to be sought in the Scriptum alone, to accompany me
in a serious and solemn examination how the Scriptura may be
properly reconciled with itself without any sophistry. Paul,

knowing the righteousness of faith to be tho refuge of those
who are destituta of any righteousness of their own, boldly
infers that all who are justified by saith, ars excluded from
’ the righteousness of worlrs. It being likewise evident, on tho
other hand, that this is common to all ballevan, he with
equal confidence concludes that no man is justified by worlrs,
bnt rather, on the contrary, that we are justified independently
of all worlts. But it is one thing to disputa concoming the
intrinsic salue of works, and another, to argue respecting the
place they ought to hold aller the establishment of the right·
eousness of faith. 11 we aro to determine the value of worlts
by their own worthiness, we say that they are unworthy to
appear in the sight of de3 that there is nothing in our works
of which we can glory before God; and consequently, that
being divested of all assistance from works, we are justified by
faith alone. Now, we describe this righteousness in the follow·
ing manner: That a sinder, being admitted to communion
with Christ, is by his grace reconciled to God; while, being

has been previously received, the good worlrs which succeod
are estimated far beyond their intrinsic merrt; for all their

IX. Now, if any one urge this to me as an objection, to
oppose the righteousness of saith, 1 will first ask him, Whother
a manis reputed righteous on account of ono or two holy
works, who is in the other actions of his life a transgressor of
the law. This would be too absurd to be pretended. lshall
next inquire, 11 he is reputed righteous ou account of many
good works‚ while he is found guilty of any instance os trans·

maintain, in opposition to the sanction of the law, which de·
