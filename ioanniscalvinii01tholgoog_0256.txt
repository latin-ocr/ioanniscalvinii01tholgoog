entirely forgotten or exploded The public assemblies have
become schools 01 idolatry and impiety. In withdrawing our-
selves, therefore, 110111 the pernicious participation 01 so many
enormities, there is no danger 01 separating ourselves from
the Church 01 Christ. 'I'he communion 01 the Church was
not instituted as a bond to confine us in idolatry, impiety,
ignorance os God, and 0111010111ος but rather as a meanto
preserve us in the scaros God, aad obedience 01 the 1111111. l
know that the Papists give us the most magnificent commen-
datious 01 their Church, to make us believe that there 10 110
other in the world ; and then, aa 11 they had gained their point,
they conclude all who dare to withdraw themselves 110111 that
Church which they describe, to be schismatica, and pronounce
all to ba heretica who venture to open their mouths in opposi-
tiou 10 110 doctrine. But by what reasons do they prove theirs
10 be the 11110 Church? 'I'hey allege 110111 ancient recorda
what formerly occurred in Italy, in France, in Spain3 that they
are descended 110111 those holy men, who by sound doctrine
founded and raised the Churches in these countries, and con-
firmed their doctrine and the edificationes the Church by
their blood3 and that the Church, thus consecrated among
them, both by spiritual gifts, and by the blood 01 martyre, hap
been preserved by a perpetual succession 01 bishops, that it
might never be lost. They allega the importanee attached 10
this succession by Irenaeus, Tertullian, origen, Augustino, and
others. To those who are willing 10 attend me in abrici
examination 01 111000 allegatione, 1 will clearly show that they
are 1111010110,ου111110111100111·1111101101ιο. 1 would likewise ex·
11011 those who advance thern, to pay a serious attention 10 the
subject, ill thought my arguments could produce any effect
upon them; but as their 00Ιο object is 10 promote their own
interest by every method in their power, without any regard
to truth, 1 shall content mysels with making a sew observatione,
with which good meu, and inquirere after truth, may be able
10 answer their cavils. In the first place,l ask thern, why
they allege nothing respectiug Africa, and Egypt, and all Asia.
Itis because, in all those countries, there has been 0101101001
this sacred succession 01 bishops, by virtue 01 which they boast
that the Church has been preserved among them. They come
10 this point, therefore, that they have the true Church, be-
cause from its commencemeut it has never been destitute 01
bishops, 101 that some have been succeeded by others in an
rminterrupted 001100. But what 11 loppose them with the ex·
ample 01 (1100001 Iask them again, therefore, why they essert
that the Church has been lost among the Greeks, among whom
there has never been any interruption 01 that successiones

bishops, which they consider as the sole guard aad preservative
