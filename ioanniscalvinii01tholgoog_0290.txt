together, and gave their united consent. And what is more, it
was within the last five hundred years that Pope Nicholas made
this decree respecting the election os the Roman pontiff ; that
the cardinals should take the lead, thatin the next place they
should unite with them the rest of the clergy, and lastly that
the election should be confirmed by the consent of the people.
And at the conclusion he recites that decree os Leo, whichl
have just quoted, and commanda it to be observed insutum.
lf the cabals of the wicked should go to such a length asto
constrain the clergy to quit the city in order to make a proper
election, still he ordains that some os the people should be
present at the same time. 'l'he consentes the emperor, aa far
as l can discover, was required only in two Churches, at Rome
and at Constantinople, because they were the two capitals of
the empire. For when Ambrose was sent to Milan with au·
thority from Valentinian to preside at the election os a new
bishop, that was an extraordinary measure, in consequence of
the grievous factione which raged among the citizens. At
Rome the authority of the emperor had auciently so much in·
fluence in the creation of a bishop, that Gregory speaks of himself
as having been appointed to the govemmeut of the Church by
the sole command os the emperor, notwithstanding he had been

when any one had been chosen by the senate, clergy, and
people‚ 1t was immediately reported to the emperor, that he might
either ratify the election by his approbation, or rescind it by his
negative. Nor is there any thing repugnant to this custom in
the decrees collected by Gratian; which only say, that it is by
no means to be suffered that a king should supersede all ca-

that the metropolitana ought not to consecrate any one who
shall thus have been promoted by the violence of power. For
it isone thing to spoil the Churoh of its right, by transferring
the whole to the caprice of an individual, and another to give
a king or an emperor the honour of confirming a legitimate
election by his authority.

XIV. lt remains sor usto state, by what ceremouy the
ministers of the ancient Church, aster their electiori, were ini-
tiated into their office. This the Latina have called ordination
or consecration. The Greeks have called it χειροςονια, catenatim
or elevatiora os hands, and sometimes yapobrna, onposition os
hands,· though the former word properly signifies that kind of
election in which the suffrages are declared by the lifting up os
the hands. There rs a decree of the Council os Nice, that the
metropolitan should meet with all the bishops of the province,
to othon him who shall have been elected; but that if any of

them be pravented bytho length of the Journey, by sickness, or
