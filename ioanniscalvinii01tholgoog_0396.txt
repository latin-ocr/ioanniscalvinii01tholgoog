cees? ”(1ι) by locvm, according to the interpretation given us
by the evangelist, intending every doctrine of their own that
they mixed with the pure word of God. What can we wish
for plaiuer, than when he commende us to avoid and beware
of all their doctrine? Hence it is very evident to us, that in
the other passage our Lord did not intend that the consciences
of his disciples should be harassed with the traditions of the
Pharisees3 and the words themselves, if they are not perverted,
convey no such meaning. For, being about to deliver asevere
invective against the conduct of the Pharisees, our Lord only
prefaced it by instructing his hearers, that though they would
see nothing iu their lives worthy of imitation, yet they should
continue to practise those things which were taught by them in
their discourses, when they were sitting iu the cheir of Moses,
that is to say, when they were expounding the law. His only
design, therefore, was to guard the people against being induced
to despise the doctrine by the bad examples of those who taught
it. But, as some persons are never affected by arguments, but
always require authority, 1 will subjoin the words of Augustino,
who gives exactly the same interpretation: “ The Lord's fold
has pastors, some faithful, some hirelings. These who are
faithful are true shepherds; yet hear how the hirelings also are
necessary. For many in the Church, pursuing worldly advan-
tages, preach Christ, aud the voice of Christ is heard through
them 3 and the sheep follow not the hireling, but the Shepherd
by means of the hireling. Hear how the hirelings are pointed
out by the Lord himself. He says, 'Phe scribes and Pharisees
sit in Moses' chair; what they say, do ; but what they do, -
imitate not. Is not this equivalent to saying, Hear the voice
of the Shepherd through the hirelings; for, sitting in the chair
of Moses, they teach the law of God3 therefore, God teaches
by them; but if they choose to teach any thing of their own,
neither attend to it, nor practice it l '³

XXVII. But, es many ignorant persons, when they hear
that the consciences of men ought not to be bound by human
traditions, and that it is in vain to worship God by such ser·
vices, immediately conclude the same rule to be applicable to
⁴ all the laws which regulata the order of the Church, we must
also refute their error. It is easy, indeed, to be deceived in this
point, because it does not immediately appear, at the first glauce,
what a difference there is between the one and the other; bnt
Iwill place the whole subject in such a clear light, in a few
words, that no one may be misled by the resemblance. ln the
first place, let us consider that if, in every society of men, we
see the necessity of some polity in order to preserve the corn·
