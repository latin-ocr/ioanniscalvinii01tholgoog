they spiritually ate, that they might be spirituolly satisfied.
For wc also, in the present day, have received visible food; but
the sacrament isone thing, and the virtue of the sacrament is
another.'’ A little after he says, “ Theresore he who abides
not in Christ, and in whom Christ does not abide, spiritually
neither eats his flesh nor drinks his blood, though he may
carnally and visibly press the sign of the body and blood

with his teeth.’' Here, again, we find the visible sign opposed ⁴

to the spiritual eating, which contradicts that error, that the in·
visible body of Christ is really eatan sacramentally, though it
be not eatan spiritually. We are informed also that nothing is
granted to the profane and impure, beyond the visible recep
tion of the sign. Hence that well known observationes his,
that thc other disciples ate the breed which was tlte Lord, but
that J udas merely ate the Lord's dread ,· by which he clearly
excludes unbelievers from the participation of the body and
blood. And to the same purpose is what he says in another
place: “Why do you wonder if the bread of Christ was given
to Judas to enslave him to the devil, when you see, on the
other hand, that the messenger of Satan was given to Paul
to make him perfect in Christ? ” (b) He says, indeed, in ano·
ther place, “That the sacramental bread was the body of
Christ to 'those to whom Paul said, He that cateth and drinketh
unworthily, eateth and drinketh judgment to himself ; (c) and
that they could not, therefore, be affirmed to have received
nothing, because they had received amiss.’' But his meaning
is more fully explained in another passage. For professedly
undertaking to describe how the body of Christ is caten by
the wicked and profligate, who confess the Christian saith
with their lips while they deny it in their actions, and that in
opposition to the opinion of some who supposed them to eat
not only the sacramental symbol, but the substance itself, he
says, “They must not be considered as eating the body of
Christ, because they are not to be nurnbered among the mem·
hers of Christ. For, to mention nothing else, they cannot,
at the same time, be the members of Christ and the membcrs
of a harlot. And where the Lord himself says, He that cateth
my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in
him3 (d) he shows what it is to eat his body, not merely in
a sacramentel way, but in truth; for this is to dwell in
Christ, that Christ may dwell in us. This is the sameas
ifhe had said, Whoever dwelleth not in me, and in whom
ldwell not, let him not say or think he eateth my body or
drinketh my blood.'' Let the readers consider the opposition
here stated between eating mwely ia a reuomentol way, and
