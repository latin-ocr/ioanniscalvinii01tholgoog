the gospel that opens heaven to us, it is beautifully expressed

by their mrbelief. lf the pope assumed nothing but this to
himself, 1 am persuaded there is uo man who would either
euvy him or contend with him—But this succession being
laboribus, and by no means lucrative, and, therefore, uot at all
satisfactory to the pope, hence arises a controversy on the
meaning of Christ’s promise to Peter. Therefore Ι infer from
the subject itself, that it only deuotes the dignity of the apos-
tolic office, which cannot be separated from the burden of it.
For if the definition which l have given be admitted, -and it
cannot without the greatest effrontery be rejected, - then here is
nothing given to Peter that was not also common to his col-
leagues; because otherwise there would not only be a personal
injnry done to them, but the majesty of the doctrine would be
diminished 'l'his our adversaries strenuously oppose. But
what does it avail them to strike upon this rock? For they
can never prove, but that as the preaching of the same gospel
was eiijoined upon all the apostles, so they were all equally
armed with the power of binding and loosing. They allege
that Christ, when he promised to give the keys to Peter, con-
stituted him head of the universal Church. But what he there
promised to one, he in another passage confers upon all the
rest together, and delivers it, as it were, into their hands. (z)
If the same power, which had been promised to one, was
granted to all, in what respect is he superior to lris colleaguest
His pree'minence, they say, consists in this -that he receives
separately by himself, as well as in common with thern, that
which is only given to the others in common. What if 1 reply,
with Cyprian aud Angustiae, that Christ did this, not to prefer
one man before others, but to display the unity of the Church?
For this is the language of Cyprian: ‘⁴ That in the person of
one man God gave the keys to them all, to signify the unity
of them all; that, therefore, the rest were, the same as Peter,
endued with an equal participation both of honour and of
power; but that Christ commences with one, to show that the
Church is one.'' Augustino says, “If there had not been in
Peter a mysterious representation of the Church, the Lord
would not have said to him, l will give thee the keys3 forif
this was said to Peter alone, the Church possesses thern not;
but ifthe Church has the heys, Peter, when he received them,
must have represented the whole Church.'’ And in another
place: “When a question was put to them all, Peter alone au·
swers, Thou art the Christ; aud to him Christ says, 1 will give
