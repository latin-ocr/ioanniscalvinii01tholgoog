X. Now, the elect are not gathered into the fold of Christ by
calling, immediately from their birth, nor all at the same tima,

but according as Gadis pleased to dispensa his grace to them. ,

Before they are gathered to that chief Shepherd, they go' a·
stray, scattered iu the common wilderness, and differing in no
respect from others, except in being protected by the special
mercy of God from rushing down the precipica of ctemal death.
If you observa them, therefore, you will see the posterity of
Adam partakiug of the common corruption of the whole spe·
cies. That they go not to the most desperate extremes of
impiety, is not owing to any innata goodness of theirs, but be-
cause tha eye of God watches over them, and his hand is ex·
tended for their preservation. For those who dream of 1 know
not what seed of electiori sown iu their hearts from their very
birth, always inclining them to piety and the fear of God, are
unsupported by the authority of Scriptura, and refuted by ex·
perience itself. They produce, indeed, a few examples to
prove that certain elect persons were not entire strangers to
religion, even before they were truly enlightened; that Paul
lived blameless in his Pharisaism3 (l) that Cornelius, with his
alms aud prayers, was accepted of God, (m) and if there are any
other similar ones. What they say of Paul, we admit, but re-
specting Cornelius, we maintain that they ara deceived3 for it
is evident, he was then enlightcned and regenerated, and
wanted nothing but a clear revelation of the gospel. But
what will they extort from these very few examples? that tha
elect have always been eudued with the spirit of piety? This
is just as if any one, having proved the integrity of Aristides,
Socrates, Xenocrates, Scipio, Curius, Camillus, and other hea-
thens, should conclude from this, that all who were left in the
darkness of idolatry, were followers of holiness and virtue.
But this is contradicted in many passages of Scriptura. Paul’s
description of the state of the Ephesians prior to regeneration,
exhibita nota grain of this seed. “ Ye were dead,'’ he says,
‘¹ in trespasses and sins, wherein intime past ye walked accord-
ing to the course of this world, according to the princa of the

power of the air, the spirit that now worketh in the children ,

of disobedienm, among whom also we all had our couversa-
tion in times past, in tha lusts of orn flesh, fulfilliug the de-
sires of tha flesh and of the mind, and were by nature tlre
children of wrath, even as others.'‘(n) Again: “Remember
that at that time ye were without hope, and without God in
the world.’·' (o) Again: “Ye were sometimes darkness, but
now are yo light in the Lord3 walk as children of light.'’ ( p)
