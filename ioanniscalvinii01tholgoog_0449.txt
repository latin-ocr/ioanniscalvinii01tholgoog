nasa Thus they diligently exercise themselves in piety: bnt
they ltnow that the exercise of the body extends only toa
short time. Charity is principally observed3 to charity the
leod, the conversation, the apparel, the countenauce, are sub-
serviant. They all assemble and combine into one charity;
to violate this, is accounted unlawsul, and asin against G0d;
is any one resist charity, he is expelled and shunned; is any
one offend against it, he is not suffered to remain a single day.''
As Augustino appears, in these passages, to have exhibited a
pertraiture of the true character os ancient monachiam, I have
thought proper, notwithstanding their length, to insert them
here; sor l saw that, however l might study brevity, yetl
should go into still greater length, if l were to collect the same
things from different authors.

X. My design bere is not to pursne the whole argument,
but merely to point out, by the way, the characters ef the
monhs who belonged to the ancient Church, and the nature of
the monastic profession at that period, that the judicious readers
may be able, from a comparison, to judge os the effrontery of
those who plead antiquity in support of the monachism of the
present day. When Augustine gives us a description of holy
and legitimate monachiam, he excludes from it all rigid exac-
tion or imposition of those things which the Lord in his word
has left free. But there is nothing at the present day more
severely enforced. 'For they consider it acrime, never to be
expiated‚ for any one to deviate in the minutest particular from
the rules prescribed in the colour or shape of their apparel, tlte
lrind of sood, or other frivolous and uninteresting ceremoniesr
Augustine strenuously contenda, that it is not lawful sor monks
to live in idleness at the expense of others. He denies that
there was such an example to be found in his time in any well
regulated monastery. 'Phe present monle place the principal
partos their sanctity iu idleness. For is they were divested
os idleness, what would become of that contemplative life, in
which they boast os excelling other men, andos making near
approaches to the lite os angela? In fine, Augustius requires
amonachism which would be no other than an exercise and
assistance in the duties os piety, which are enjoined on all
Christiane. What! when he represents charityas the principal
aud almost only rnle of it, can we suppose him tobe commend-
ing a conspiracy, by which a few menate closely united to
each other, and separated from the whole body of the Church?
On the contrary, he would have them to enlighten others by
their example, in order to the preservation of the unity os the
' Church. ln both these respecta, the nature of modern mona-
chiam is so different, that it is scarcely possible to find any
thing more dissimilar or opposite. For, not content with that
