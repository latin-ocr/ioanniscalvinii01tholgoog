things in the mind and understanding, they are thence said
scire, “to knoW,” whence is derived the word scientia,
“science '' or “knowledge ; '’ so when they have a sense of
Divino justice, as an additional witness, which permits them
not to conceal their sins, orto elude accusation at the tribunal
of the supreme Judge, this sense is tenned conscientia, “con-
science’' For it is a kind os medium between God and man;
because it does not suffer a man to suppress what he knows
within himself, but pursues him till it brings him to conviction.
This is what Paul meane by “their conscience also bearing
witness, and their thoughts accusing, or else excusing, one
another.’' (r) Simple knowledge might remain, as it were,
confined within a man. This sentiment, therefore, which
places man before the Divine tribunal, is appointed, as it were,
to watch over man, to observe and examine all his secrete, that
nothing may remain enveloped in darkness. Hence the old
proverb, Conscience is as a thousand witnesses. For the same
reason Peter speaks of “the answer of a good conscience
towards God,'’ (s) to express our tranquillity of mind, when,
persuaded of the favour os Christ, we present ourselves with
boldness in the presence of God. And the author of the
Epistle to the chrews expresses absolution or freedom from.
every future charge of sin, by “having no more conscience
of sin.'’ t

xva (iherefore, es works respect men, so conscience regards
God; so that a good conscience is uo other than inward in·
tegrity of heart. ln which sense Paul says, that “the end of
thc commandment is charity, out of epure heart, and of a good
conscience, and of saith unseigned.''(u) Afterwards also, in
the same chapter, he shows how widely it differs from under·
standing, saying, that “some, having put away a good con·
scicnce, concerning faith have made shipwreck.”(w) For
these words indicate that it is a lively inclination to the service
of God, and a sincere pursuit of piety and holiness of life.
Sometimes, indeed, it is likewise extended to men; as when
the same apostle declares, “ Herein do l exercise mysclf, to
have always a conscience void of offence toward God and
toward men.'’ (c) But the reason of this assertion is, that the
fruits of a good conscience reach even to men. But in strict
propriety of speech it has to do with Godalonc‚as1have
already observed. Hence it is that a laW, which simply binds
a man without relation to other men, or any consideration of
thern, is said to bind the conscience. For example, God not
only enjoins the preservation of the mind chaste and pure from
every libidinous desire, but prohibite all obscenity of languagc
