blasphemy. 'Phe refractory mind will discover aa much inso-
lence,on hearing that there are three persons in the Divina
assence, ason being told, that when God created man, he sore·
saw what would happerr concaming him. Nor will they
refrain from derision on being informed, that little more than
five thousand years have elapsed since the creation of the
world. They will ask why the power os God was so long idle
and aslcep. Nothing can be advanced which they will not
endeavour to ridicule. blust we, in order to checlr these sacri·
leges, say nothing of tha Divinity ol' the Son and Spirit, or pass
over in silence the creation of the world? ln thia instance, and
every other, the truth of God is too powersul to dread the
detraction ol impioua men; aa is strenuoualy maintained by
Angustiae, inhia treatise ou the Perseverance of the Faithsul.
We see the salse apostlea, with all their delamation and accu-
sation os the true doctrine oi Paul, could never aucceed to
make him ashamed of it. Their assertion, that all this discus·
sion is dangeroua to pious minda, because it ia inconsistent
with exhortatione, shakes their saith, and disturbs and discou-
rages the heart itself, is without any foundation. Augustius
admits, that he was frequently blamed, on these accounts, sor
preaching predestination too frcely; but he readily aud arn·
ply refutes them. But aa many and various absurdities are
crowded upon us hera, we prefer reserving every one to bc
refuted in its proper place. Ionly desire this general admis-
sion, that we should neither scrutinize those things which the
Iord has left concealed, nor neglect those which he has openly
exhibited, lest we be condemned for excessivo curiosity on the
one hand, or for ingratitudo on the other. For it ia judiciously
remarked by Augustino, that we may safely follow the Scrip-
ture, which proceeds aa with the pace ol' a mother atooping to
the weakneas of a child, that it may not leave our weak capa·
citios behind. But persons who are so cautious or timid, as to
wish predestination to be buried in silence, lest seeble minda
should be disturbed, - with what pretext, 1 aslr, will they gloss
over their arrogance, which indirectly charges God with foolish
inadvertcncy, aa though he sorcsaw not the danger which they
suppose they have had the penetration to discover. Whoever,
therefore, endeavours to raiae prejudicea against the doctrine
os predestination, openly reproaches God, as though something
had inconsiderately escaped from him that is pernicious to the
Ohurch.

V. Pradestination, by which God adopts some to the hopa
of lise, and adjudges others to eternal death, no one, desirous
of the creditos piety, dares absolutely to deny. But it is in·
volved in many cavils, especially by those who make sore-
knowladga the cauae of it. We maintain, that both belong to
