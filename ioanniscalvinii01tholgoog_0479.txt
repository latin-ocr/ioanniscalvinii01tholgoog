more suitable occasion for puisuing in another place. Ablu-
tions and purificatione placed before their eyes their uncleaimess
and pollution‚ by which they were naturally contaminated, and
promised another ablution, by which they would be purified
from all their defilement; and this ablution was Christ, washed
in whose blood we bring his purity into the presence of God
to cover all our impurities. (s) Their sacrifices accused and
convicted them of their iniquity, and, at the same time, taught
the necessity of some satisfaction to be made io the Divine
justice, and that, therefore, there would come a great High
Priest, a Mediator between God and men, who was to satisfy
the justice of God by the effusion of blood and the oblation of
asacrifice, which would be sufficient to obtain the remissiori
of sins. This great High Priest was Christ, he shed his own
blood, and was himself the victim5 was obedierit to his Father
even unto death, and by his obedience obliterated the disobe-
dience of inan, which had provoked the indignation of God. (g)

XXII. Our two sacraments present us with a clearer exhibi-
tion of Christ, in proportion to the nearer view of him which
men have enjoyed-siiice he was really manifested by the Father
in the manner in which he had been promised. For baptism
testifies to us our purgatiori and ablution; the eucharistie
supper testifies our redemption. Water is a figure of ablution,
and blood of satisfaction. These things are both found in
Christ, who, as John says, “ came by water and blood; '' (11)
that is, to purify and redeam. Of this the Spirit of God is a
witness; or, rather, “there are three that bear witness, the
Spirit, the Water, and the Blood.'' (i) In the water and
the blood we have a testimony of purgatiori and redemp-
tion; and the Spirit, as the principal witness, confirms and
secures our reception and belief of this testimony. This
sublime mystery was strikingly exhibited on the cross, when
blood and water issucd froin Christ's sacred side, which, on
this account, Augustine has justly called “ the fountain of our
sacramenta ς ” of which we are yet to treat moreat large. And
there is no doubt, if we compare one time with another, but that
the more abundarit grace of the spiritis also here displayed.
For that belongs to the glory of the kingdom of Christ3 as
we gather froin various places, and especially from the seventh
chapter of John, lii this sense we must understand that pas-
sage where Paul, speaking of the legal institutione, says, “which
are a shadow of things to conia, but the body is of Christ.’‘ (fr)
His design in this declaration is, not to deiiy the efficacy of
those testimonias of grace, in which God was formerly pleased
