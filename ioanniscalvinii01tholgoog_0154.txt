to approach nuto thee; he shall dwell in thy courts.” (z)
But since the electiori hidden in God hasbeen confirmed by
the first deliverance, as well as by the second audather inter·
mediate blessings, the word choose is transferred to it in lsaiah:
“The Lord will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
lsrael 3 '² (a) because, contemplating a future period, he declares
that the collection of the residue of the people, whom he had
appeared to have forsaken, would be a sign of the stabla and
sure electiori, which had likewise seemed to fail. When he
says also, in another place, “l have chosen thee, and not cast
thee away,'' (b) he commends the continual course os his sig-
nal liberality and paternal benevolence. The angel, iu Zacha-
nah, speaks more plainly: “The Lord shall choose Jerusalem
again;’' (c) aa though his severe chastisement had been a
rejection, or their exile had been an interruptiones electi0n;

Ι which, nevertheless, remeius inviolable, though the tokens of

it are not always visible.

Vl. We must now proceed toa second degree of electiora,
still more restricted, or that in which the Divino grace was
displayed in a more special manner, when of the same racc of
Abraham God rejected some, and by nourishing others in the
Ohurch, proved that he retained thern among his children
Ishmael at first obtained the same station as his brother Isaac,
for the spiritual covenant was equally scaled in him by the
symbol of circumcision. He is cut off3 afterwards Esau3
lasdy, an innumerable multitude, and almost all lsrael. In
Isaac the seed was called ; the same calling continued in Jacob.
God exhibited a similar example in the rejectiou of Saul, which
is magnificently celebrated by the Psalmist: “He refused the
tabernacle of loseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but
chose the tribe of Judah3 '² (d) and this the sacred history fre·
quently repeats, that the wonderful secret of Divine grace may
be more manifest in that change. l grant, it was by their own
crime and guilt that Ishmael, Esau, and persons of similar cha-
racters, fell from the adoption ; because the condition annexed
waS, that they should faithfully keep the covenant of God,
which they perfidiously violated. Yet it was apecnliar favour
of God, that he deigned to prefer them to other nations; as it
is said in the Psalms: “ He hath not dealt so with any nation ξ
and as sor his judgments, they have not known .them.''(e)
But 1 have justly said that here are two degrees to be remarked;
for in the election of the whole nation, God has already shown
that in his rnere goodness he is bound by no laws, but is per-
fectly free, so that none can require of him an equal distribu-
