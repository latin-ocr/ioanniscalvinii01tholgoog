we bear m our body the marks of our Lord and illuster ,(ro)
which arethe badges of the children of God The seme
sentiment is conveyed ιιι the following passages· “Hearing
about' m the body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also
ofJesusmightbemsdemanifestinourbodyJ ’(ιι)ι ‘Bcingmsde
conformsble ιιιιιο his death, if by any means 1 might attain
unto the resurrection of the desd.” (y) The reason which the
apostle subjoins tends not to establish sny merit, but to confirm
the hope of the kingdom of God3 ss though he had said, As it is
consistent with the judgment of Godto avenge on your enemies
those vexatione with which they have harassed you, so it is
also to grant you respite and reposo from those vexatione Of
the other passage, which represents it as becoming the right·
eousness of God not ιο forget our services, so as almost to im·
ply that he would be unrighteous if he did forget them, the
meaning is, that m order ιο arouse our indolence, God has as·
euredus thet the labour which we undergo for th'e glory of his
name shall not be in vain. And we should always remember
that this promise, as well es ull others, would be fraught with no
benerit ιο us, unless it were preceded by the gratuitous cove-
nent of merey, on which the whole certainty of our salvation
must depend. But relying on that covensnt, we may securely
confide, thet our services, however unworthy, will not go with·
out a reward from the goodness of God. 'I'o confirm us in that
expectation, the apostle asserts thet God is not unrighteous,
but will perform the promise he has once made. This right·
eousness, therefore, refers rather ιο the truth of the Divine
promise, than ιο the equity of rendering tous any thing that is
our due. To this purpose thereis a remarkable observation of
Augustius, and as that holy man has not hesitated frequently
to repeat it as deserving of remembrence, so l deem it not un·
worthy of a constant place in our minds. “The Lord,'‘ says
he, “is faithful, who has made himself our dcbtor, not by
receiving any thing from us, but by promising all things to us.’'

VIII. Our Pharisees adduce the following passages of Paul:
“ Though Ι have all faith, so that 1 could remove mountains,
and have not charity, 1 em nothing.” Again: “Now abidetb
saith, hope, charity, these three; but the greatest of these is
charity.'' (z) Again: “ Abovo all these things, put on eharity,
which is the bond of perfeotness.’' (a) From the first two pes-
sages they contend that we are justified rather by cherity than
by faith; that is, by the superior virtue, as they express it.
But this argumentis easily overtumed. For we bave already
shown, that what is mentioned in the first passage, has no
