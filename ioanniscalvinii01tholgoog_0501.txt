ancient people, as though the grace of God were more restrict-
ed now thenit was under the law3 it leads to the conclusion
that Christ came not to fulfil the promises, but to abolish
them; since the promise, which at that time was of itself suf·
ficiently efficacious to insure salvation before the eighth day,
would have uo validity now without the assistance of the sigu.

XXI. What was the custom of the Church before Augustine
was born, may be collected from the ancient fathers. ln the
first place, Tertullian says, “That it is not permitted for a
woman to speak iu the Church, neither to teach, uor to bap·
tize, nor to offer, that she may not claim to herself the func·
tions of any office belonging to men, and especially to priests.''
The same thing is fully attested by Epiphanius, when he
censuras Marcion for having given women liberty to baptiza.
Iam aware of the answer made to this by persons of opposite
sentiments -that there is a great difference between a common
usage, and an extraordinary remedy employed in cases of ur·
gent uecessity; but when Epiphanius prouounces it to be a
moekery, without making any exception, to give women
liberty to baptize, itis sufficiently evident that he condemns
this corruption, and considers it inexcusable by auy pretext
whatever; nor does he add any limitation, in his third book,
where he observes that this liberty was not granted evento
the holy mother os Christ.

XXll. Tne example of Zipporah isalleged, but is not appli-
cable to the case. Because the angel of God was appeased after
she had taken a stone and circumcised her sou, (v) it is unrea·
sonable to infer that her action was approved by God. On the
same principle it might be maintained, that God was pleased
with tha worship established by the natione who were trans·
’ planted from Assyria to Samaria But thare are other power-
ful reasons to prove the absurdity os settiug up the conduct
of that foolish woman asa pattem for imitation. If I should
allega, that this was a single act, which ought not to be con·
sidered as a general example, aud especially as we nowhere
find any special command that the rite of circumcision wasto
be performed by the priests, the case of circumcision is differ·
ent from that of baptism; and this would be sufficient to re·
fute the advocates of its administration by women. For the
words of Christ are plain: “Ge ye, therefore, and teach all
natione, baptizing them.’'(to) Since he coustitutes the same
persons preachers of the gospel and administratore of baptism,
“and no mau,’' according to the testimony of the apostle,
“ taketh this honour upon himself, but he thetis called of God,
ae was Aaron,’' (a) whoever baptizes without a legitimate call,
