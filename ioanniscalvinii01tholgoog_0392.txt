XXII. As if any faithful pastors, who preside over churches
not yet well regulated, were ιο recommend all their people not
to eat meat openly on Fridays, or to labour publicly on festi·
vals, or the like, till their weaker neighbours should be more
established. For though, setting aside superstition, these things
are in themselves indifferent, yet when they are attended with
offences to brethren, they cannot be performed without sin;
and the times are such that believers could not do these things
in the presence of their weak brethren, without most grievously
wounding their consciences. Who but a caviller would say
that in this instance they made a new law, whereas it would
evidently appear that their sole object was ιο guard against of-
fences which are most expressly forbidden by the Lord? No
more can it be said of the apostles‚ who had no other design in
removing the occasion of offences, than ιο urge the Divine law
respecting the avoidance of offence3 as though they had said,
It is the command of the Lord that you hurt not your weak
brother; you cannot eat meats offered ιο idols, or blood, or
things strangled, without your weak brethren being offended;
therefore, we command you by the word of the Lord not to
eat with offence. And that such was the intention of the
apostles‚ Paul himself isan unexceptionable witness, who, cer·
tainly in consistence with their sentence, writes in the follow·
ing manner: “As concerning the eutiug of those things that are
offered in sacrifice unto idols, we know that an idol is nothing.
Howbeit, there is not iu every man that knowledge; for some
with conscience of the idol, eat itas a thing offered unto an idol ;
and their conscience, being weak, is defiled. 'Pake head lest
by any means this liberty of yours become a stumbling·block
to them that are weak.'’ (ο) He who shall have duly considered
these things, will not afterwards be deceived by the fallacy of
those who attempt ιο justify their tyranny by the example of
the apostles‚ as if they had begun· ιο infringe the liberty of
the Ohurch by their decree. But that they may not be able
to avoid confirming this solution by their own confession, let
them tell me by what right they have dared to abrogate that de·
eree. They can only reply, Because there was no more danger
from those offences and dissensione which the apostles intended
to guard against, and they knew that a law was to be judged
of by the end for which it was made. As this law, therefore,
is admitted to have been made from a consideration of charity,
there is nothing prescribed in it any further than charity is
concerned. When they confess that the transgression of this
law is uo other than a violation of charity, do they not thereby
acknowledge that it is not a novel addition ιο the law of uod,
