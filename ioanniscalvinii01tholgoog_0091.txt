abomination3 as are also their sacrifices ; for it is reasonable,
that they who shut up their own hearts, should find the ears
of God closed against them3 and God should be inflexible to
them who provoke his rigour by their obduracy. ln lsaiah, hc
threatens thus: “When ye make many prayers, l will not
hear: your hands are full of blood.'’ (o) Again in Jeremiah:
“I protested, yet they inclined not their ear. Therefore,
though they shall cry unto me, l will not hearken unto
them.'’ (p) Because he considers himself grossly insulted by
the wicked boasting of his emanant, while they are continually ,
dishonouring his sacred name. Wherefore he complains, in
Isaiah, “This people draw near me with their mouth, but
have removed their beart far from me.'' (q) He does not re·
strict this solely to prayer, but asserts his abhorrcnce of hy·
pocrisy in every brauch of his worship. Which is the meaning
of this passage in James: “Ye ask, and receive not, because
ye ask amiss, that ye may consume it upon your lusts.’' (r) It
is true, indeed, (as we shall presently again see,) that the
prayers of the faithful depeud not on their personal worthiness;
yet this does not supersede the admonition of John: “ What·
soever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his com·
mandments; '' (s) because an avil conscience shuts the gata
against us. Whence it follows, that none pray aright, and that
no others are heard, but the sincere worshippers of God. Who·
soever therefore engages in prayer, should be displeased with
himself on account of his sins, and assume, what he cannot do
without repentance, the character and disposition of a beggar.

Vlll. 'Po these must be added a third mle-That whoever
presents himself before God for the purpose of pmying to him,
must renouncc every idea of his own glory, reject all opinion
of his own merit, and, in a word, relinquish all confidence in
himself, giving, by this humiliation of himself, all the glory
entirely to God; lest, arrogating any thing, though ever so
little, to oruselves, we perish from his presence in consequence
of our vanity. Of this submission, which prostrates every high
thought, we have frequent examples in the servants of God;
of whom the most eminentior holiness feel the greatest con·
sternation on entering into the presence of the Lord. Thus

⁴ Daniel, whom the Lord himself has so highly commended,

said, “We do not present our supplications before thee for our
righteousness, but for thy great mercios. OLord, hear3 Ο
Lord, forgive; 0 Lord, heerken and do ; defer not, for thina
own sake, Ο my God; for thy city and thy people are called
by thy name.'’(t) Nor does he, as is generally the case,
confound himself with the multitude, as one of the people,
