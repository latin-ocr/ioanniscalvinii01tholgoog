referred to the judgment of the bishop. As l'or example, is any
ecclesiastic had committed no crime against the laws, but was

only charged with offending against the canons, he was not '

summoned to the common tribunal, but was judged by the
bishop. ln like manner, if a question was agitated respecting
an article of saith, or any other subject properly belonging to the
Church, to the Church the cognizance os it was committed.
ln this sense is to be understood what Ambrose writes to the
emperor Valentinian: “ Your father, of august memory, not only
auswered verbally, but also ordained by edicts, that, in a cause
relating to saith, he ought to judge, who is not disqualified by
office or dignity.'' Again: “If we regard the Scriptores or
ancient examples, who will deny that in a cause of faith,—I
say, in a cause os saith,—it is customary for bishops to judge οἰ
Christian emperors, and not emperors os bishops l ” Again: “ 1
would have come to your consistory, sire, if either the bishops
or the people would have suffered me to go; but they say, that
acause of saith ought to be discussed in the Church, in the pre-
sence of the people.'’ He contended that aspiritual cause-
that is, a cause affecting religion -ought not to he carried intoa
civil court, where secular controversias are agitated3 and his con·
etancy in this respect has been universally and justly applauded.
Yet, nowithstandlng the goodness os his cause, he went no
further than to declara, that if the emperor proceeded to employ
force, he would submit. He says, “1 will not voluntarily desert
the station committed to me: in case os compulsion,l know
not how to resist, sor our arms are prayers and tears.'’ Let us
observa the singular combination of moderatiori and prudence
with magnanimity and confidence in this holy man. J ustina,
the mother ol the emperor, because she could not induce him
to join the Arians, endeavoured to deprive him of his bishopric.
And she would have succeeded in her attempta, is, in compliance
with the summons, he had gone to the palece os the emperor to
plead his cause. Therefore he denied the emperor to be a
competent judge os so important a controversy3 and this was
necessary both stom the circumstances os that time, and from
the invariable nature of the subject itself. For he was of
opinion, that it was his duty to suffer death rather than, by hie
consent, to permit such an example to be transmitted to posterity3
and yet in case ol violence being employed, he cherished not a
thought ol resistance. For he denied it to be compatible with
the character of a bishop to defend the saith and privileges of
the Ghurch by arms; but in other cases he showed himself
ready to do whatever the emperor would command. “ll he
demanda tribute,'' says he, “we do not refuso it; the lande

of the Church pay tribute. Il' he demands the lands, he has ,

power to take themgznone os us will oppose him.'’ Gregory
vor.. 11. .
