fully excited ιο Ιιοιιιιιιι, then when waere informed by John,
that “every man that hath thie hope ιιι him pun'heth him·
aelf, even ιι God ie pure?'’ (r) Or when Paul says, “Hav-
ing therefore these promisee, (relative to our adoption) lat
ue cleanee ourselvae from all filthineee of tha tlash and
spirit?” (ι) or than when we haar Christ propoeing himself
ae our example, that we should follow his steps? (ι)

men; for if Iwere diapoaed to quota every particular passage,
lehould produce a large volume. The apostlae ιιι quite full
of admonitione, exhortatione, and reproofe, ιο “ furnish the mau
of God unto ell good worlre,'' (ιι) and that without ιιιι men·
tion of merit But they rather deduce their principal exhorte-
tione from thie consideration, That our salvation depende not
on any merit of oure, but merely οιι the marey of God Aa
Paul, after having very largely shown that we can have ιιο
hope of life, but from tha righteousness of Christ, when he
proceeds to exhortatione, beeeechee ιιι ‘⁴ by tha merciae of
God” with which we have been favoured. (ι) And indeed
thie ona reason ought to be enough ; thet God may be glori·
hed in us. (w) But if any pareone be not ιο powersully ιι·
fected by the glory of God, yet the remembranceof hie benerit·
should be amply sufficient to incita them to rectitude of cou-

some servile and constrained acts of obedience to the law, are
guilty of falsehood when they affirm that we have no argu·

not proceed' ιιι the same ιιι( ιι though, tr'uly, such obedi·
ance were very pleasing ιο God, who declares that he‘ ‘loveth
acbeerful giver3’ ’and forbids any thing to be given “·gmdg
ingly, orof necessity’ ’(ι) Νοι do l ιιι this, ιιιιιιιι l either
reject or neglect that kind of exhortation‚ which the Scriptura
frequently uses, that no methodos enimating us to our duty
may be omitted. lt mentions the reward which “God will
render to every man according ιο hie worke;’' (ι) but that
thie ie the only argument, or the principal one,l deny. ln

Moraover, 1 contend that it hae no tendency to establieh the
merit preached by these men, ae we shall afterwards eee; and,
laetly, that it is entirely useless, unless preceded by thie doc·
trine, That we are justified soleiy on account of the merit of
Christ, apprehended by felth, and not on account os any merit
in our own works3 because none can be capable of the pureuit

of holiness, but auch ae have previously imbibed this doctrine
