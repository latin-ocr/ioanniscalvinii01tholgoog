shows us our mortification in Christ, and our new life in him.
For, as the apostle says, “ So many of usas were baptized into
lesus Christ, were baptized into his death: therefore we are
buried with him by baptism into death, that we should walls
in newness of life.’' (y) ln this passage he does not merely
exhort us to an imitation of Christ, as if he had said, that we
are admonished by baptism, that after the example of his death
we should die to sin, and that after the example of his resur-
rection we should rise to righteousness; but he goes considera·
bly further, and teaehes us, that by baptism Christ has made us
partakers of his death, in order that we may be ingrafted into
it. And as the scion derives substance and nourishment from
the root on which it is ingrafted, so they, who receive baptism
with the saith with which they ought to receive it, truly ex·
perience the efficacy of Christ's death in the mortification of
the flesh, and also the energy of his resurrection in the vivifi-
cation of the spirit. Hence he deduces matter of exhortation,
that, if we are Christians, we ought to be “dead uuto sin, but
alive unto God.’' (z) He uses the same argument in another
place; that we “are circumcised, putting off the body of the
sius of the flesh,” after we have been ‘¹ buried with’' Christ
“iu baptism.''(a) And in this sense, in the passage already
quoted, he calls it “the washing of regeneration and renew-
ing.” (b) Thus we are promised, first, the gratuitous remis-
sion of sins, and imputation of righteousness3 and, second·
ly, the grace of the Holy Spirit to reform us to newness
of life.

v1. The last advantage which our faith receives from bap·
tism, is the certain testimony it affords us, that we are not only
ingrafted into the life aud death of Christ, but are so united as to
be partakers of all his benefits. For this reason he dedicated
and sanctified baptism in his own body, that he might have it
in common with us, as a most firm bond of the union and
society which he has condescended to form with us; so that
Paul proves from it, that we are the children of God, because
we have put on Christ in baptism. (e) Thus we see that the
accomplishment of baptism is in Christ ; whom, on this account,
we call the proper object of baptism. Therefore it is no wonder
if the apostlcs baptized in his name, (d) though they had also
been commanded to baptiza in the name of the Father and of
the Spirit. (e e) For all the gifts of God, which are presented
in baptism, are found in Christ alone. Yet rt cannot be but
that he who baptizes into Christ, equally involres the name of
the Father and of the Spirit. For we have purification m his
