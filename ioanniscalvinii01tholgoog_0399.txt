constitutions of the Ohnreh which we receive as holy and use-
ful, may be classed under two heads3 some refer to rites and
ceremonies, others to discipline and peace.

XXX. But, because there is danger here, on the one hand,
that the salse bishops may seize a preterit to excuse their im·
pious aud tyrannical laws, and, on the other, that there may be
some persons who, from au excessive fear of falling into the
evils we have mentioned, will reject all ecclesiastical laws,
however holy and usefnl they may be, —it is necessary to pro-
test, that l approve of no human constitutions, except such as
are founded ou the authority of God, and deduced from the
Scriptnre, so that they may be considered as altogether Divine.
let us take, as an example, the kneeling practised during
solemn prayers. The question is, whether it be a human tra-
dition, which every one is at liberty to reject or neglect. 1
answer that it is at once both human and Divine. Itis of God,
as it forms a branch of that decorum which is recommended to
our attention and observance by the apostle ; it is of men, as it
particularly designates that which had in general been rather
hinted than clearly expressed. From this single example, it is
easy to judge what opinion ought to be entertained of all the
rest. Because the Lord, in his holy eracles, has faithfully corn-
prehended and plainly declared to us the whole nature of true
righteousness, and all the parts of Divine worship, with what-
ever is necessary to salvation, -in these things he is to be re·
garded as our only Master. Because, in external discipline and
ceremonies, he has not been pleased to give us minute directions
what we ought to do in every particular case, foreseerng that
this would depeud on the different circumstances of different
periods, and knowing that one form would not be adapted to
ell ages—here we must have recourse to the general mles which
he has given, that to them may be conformed all the regula-
tious which shall be necessary to the decorum and order of the
Ohurch. Lastly, as he has delivered no express injunctions on
this subject, because these things are not necessary to salva-
tion, and ought to be applied to the edification of the Chumh,
with a variety suitable to the manners of each age and nation,
therefore, as the benefit of the Ohurch shall require, it will be
right to change aud abolish former regulations, and to institute
new ones. 1 grant, indeed, that we ought not to resort to in-
novation rashly or frequently, or for trivial causes. But charity
will best decide what will injure or edify, and if we submit to
the dictates of charity, all will be well.

XXXI. Now, such regulations as have been made upon this
principle and for this end, it is the duty of Christian people to
observe, with a free conscience, indeed, and without any super-
stition, yet with a pious and ready inclination3 they must not
