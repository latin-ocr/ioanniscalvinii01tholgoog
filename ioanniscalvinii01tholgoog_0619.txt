of religion is to be sought and learned from some other quarter.
The wisdom of God, therefore, celestial trutlr, all the doctrine
of Christ, only begins to make Christians3 oil completas them.
Such a sentiment condemns all the apostles‚ and a number of
martyrs who, it is certain, had never received this unction.
For the holy chrism, the perfusmn of which would complete
their Christianity, or rather make them Christians from being
no Christians at all, had not then been manufactured. But these
chrismatics abundantly confuta themselves, without my saying
a word. For how small a partos their people do they auoint
after baptism? Why, then, do they suffer such semi-Christiane
in their own community, from an imperfectiori which they
might easily remedy? Why do they, with such supine neg·
ligence, suffer them to omit that which cannot be omitted
without great criminality? Why do they not more rigidly
insist upon a thing so necessary and indispensable to salvation,
unless any one be prevented by sudden death? Surely while
they suffer it to be so easily despised, they tacitly confess it not
to be of so much importance as they pretend it to be.

X. ln the last place, they determine that this sacred unction
ought to be held in greater reverence than baptism, because
it is only dispensed by the hands of the greatest prelateS,
whereas baptism is commonly administered by all priests Must
they not be considered as evideiitly mad, who discover such
fondness for their own inventione, that, in comparison with
them, they presume to undervalue the sacred institutione of
God? Sacrilegious mouth, dost thou dare to place an unction,
which is only defrled with thy fetid breath, and enchanted by
the muttering of a few words, on a level with the sacrament
of Christ, and to compare it with water sanctified by the word
of Godt But this would not satisfy thy presumption; thou
hast even given it the preference! These are the responsas
of the Holy See; they are the oracles of the apostolic tripod.
But some of thern have begun to moderate this infatuation,
which even in their opinion was carried beyond all due limits.
Confirmation is to be regarded, they say, with greater reverencc
than baptism ; not, perhaps, for the greater virtue and advantage
that it confers, but because it is dispensed by persons of supe-
rior dignity, and is applied to the nobler part of the body, that
is, the forehead; or because it contributes a greater augmen·
tation of virtues, though baptism is more available to remissiori.
But in the first reason, do they not betray themselves to be
Donatists, who estimate the virtue of the sacrament by the
dignity or worthiness of the minister? I will grant, however,
that confirmation be considered as more excellent from the
dignity of episcopal hands. But if any one inquire of them
how such a prerogativa has been conferred on bishops, what
