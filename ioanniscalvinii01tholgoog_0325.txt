what violent contantinus there were in ancient times on this
subject. For there has never mena period when the Roman
see did not aspire to some authority over other Churches. And
it will not be unsuitable to the present occasion to investigate
the meana by which it gradually rose to some power. lam
not yet speaking of that unbounded empire which it has more
recently usurped3 thatl shall defer to its proper place. But
here it will be necessary to point out in a few words in what
manner and by what methodo it formerly exalted itself, so as
to assume any jurisdiction over other Ohurches. When the
Bastern Charches were disturbed and divided by the factione
of the Ariana, in the reign of Constantius and Constans, sona
of Constantine the Great, and Athanasius, the principal defend·
er of the orthodox faith, was driven from his sea, that calamity
constrained him to go to Rome, in order that, by the authority
of the Roman see, he might in some degree repress the rage
of his enemies, and confirm the faithful, who were in extreme
distrees. He was honourably received by Julius, then bishop

punishments which they deserred, they resorted thither aa to a
common asylum. Therefore, if a priest was condemned by
his bishop, or a bishop by the synod of his province, they im·
mediately appealed to Rome. And the bishops of Rome
received such appeals with culpabla eagernma considering it
as a kind of extraordinary power to interfere in the concems
of distant Churches 'I'hus when Eutyches was condemned
by Flavianus, patriarch of Constantinople, he complained to
leo that he had been treated with injustiee. Leo, without
any delay, but with equal temerity and expedition, undertoolr
the patronage of a bad cause, issued bitter invectivas against
Flavianus, as if he had condemned an innocent man without
hearing his defence, and by this ambitione conduct he for some
time afforded considerable support to the impiety of Eutyches
