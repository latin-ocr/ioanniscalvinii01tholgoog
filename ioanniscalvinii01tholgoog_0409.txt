it employa admonitione, and pronounces excommunication.
Is it thus that they trifle with God? Does a poor man owe a
sum ol money? He is cited. ls he appear, he is condemned 3
after the condemnation, is he do not pay, he is admonished:
after the second admonition, they proceed to excomnrtmication.
tf he do not appear to the citation, he is admonished to be

forthcoming: is he delay, he is admonished a second time, and
soon alter is excommunicated. 1 ask, What is there in this that
bears any resemblance to the institution ol Christ, the ancient
usage, or the order os the Church? It is further alleged, that
this court also corrects vices. 1 reply, that acts ot‘ fomication,
lasciviousness, and drunkenness, and similar enormities, they
not only tolerate, but sanction and encourage, by a kind os tacit
approbation, and that not only in the people, but even in the
olergy themselves. Among multitudes os offenders, they only
sammon a few, either to avoid too flagrant an appearance os
connivance, or for the purpose of extorting money. I say
nothing of the robbery‚ the rapine, the peculation, the sacrilege,
connected with this office. 1 say nothing of the characters of
most of the persons selected to discharge it. Itis more than
sufficient for us, that while the Romanists boast os their spiritual
jurisdiction, it is easy to show that nothing is more contrary to
the order appointed by Christ> and that it has no more resem-

VIll. Though we have not said all that might be adduced
for this purpose, and what we have said has been condensed
within a small compass, yet 1 trust wa have so reluted our
adversaries, as to leave no room for any one to doubt that the
spiritual power arrogated by the pope and all his hierarchy, is
atyrannical usurpation, chargeable with impious opposition to
the word of God, and injustice to his people. Under the term
spiritual power,1 include their audacity in fabricating new
doctrines, by which they have seduced the unhappy people
from the native purity of the word of God, the iniquitous
traditione by which they have insuared them, and the pretended
ecclesiastical jurisdiction which they exercise by their suffragans,
vicars, penitentiaries, and officials. For if we allow Christ any
kingdom among us, all this kind ol' domination must immedi-
ately sall to the ground. The power os the sword, which they
also claim, as that is not exercised over consciences, but operates
on property, is irrelevant to our present subject 3 though in this
also it is worth while to remark, that they are always consistent
with themselves, andare at the greatest possible distance srom
the character they would be thought to sustain, as pastors of
the Charch. Here Iam not censuring the particular vices ot‘
individuale, but the general wickednesa and common pest of
tha whole order, which they would consider as degraded, is
