the apostle say, that “ no man taheth ’² the name and “honour ’⁹
of the priesthood “ unto himself, but he that is called of God,
as was Aaron,” and that even “Christ glorified not himself to
be made a high-priest,” but obeyed the call of his Father; (n)
either they must prove God to he the author and institutores
their priesthood, or they must confess the honour not to be of
God, into which they have presumptuously and wickedly ob·
truded themselves, without any call. But they cannot pro-
duce a tittle which affords the least support to their priesthood.
What, then, will become of their sacrifices, since no sacrifices
can be offered without a priest?

X. If any one should bring forward mutilated passages, ex-
tracted from different parts of the writings of the fathers, and
contend, on their authority, that the sacrifice which is offered
in the supper ought to be understood in adifferent manner
from the representation we have given of it, he shall receive
the following brief reply: lf the question relate to an approba-
tion of this notion of a sacrifice which the Papists have invent-
ed in the mass, the ancient fathers are very far from connte-
nancing such a sacrilege. They do, indeed, use the word
sacrifice, but they at the same time fully declare, that they
mean nothing more than the commemoration of that true and
only sacrifice which Christ, whom they invariably speak of as
our only Priest, completed on the eross. Augustino says, ‘¹ The
Hebrews, in the animal victims which they offered to God,
celebrated the prophecy of the future victirn which Christ has
since offered ; Christiane, bythe holy oblation and participation
of the body of Christ, celebrate the remembranee of the sacrifice
which is already eompleted.” Here he evidently inculcatas
the same sentiment thetis expressed more at large in the
Treatise, on Faith, which hasbeen attributed to him, though
it is doubtful who was the author, addressed to Peter the
Deaoon; in which we find the following passage: “ Hold this
most firmly, and admit not the least doubt, that the only
begotten Son of God himself, being made fiesh for ns, bath
offered himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
sweet·smelling savour; to whom, with the Father and the
Holy Spirit, animale were sacrificed in the time of the Old
Testament3 and to whom now, with the Father and the Holy
Spirit, (with whom he has one and the same Divinity,) the holy
Chnrch, throughout the world, oeases not to offer the sacrifice of
bread aud wine. F'or in those carnal victims there was a pre-
figuration of the fiesh of Christ, which he himself was to offer
for our sins, andos his blood, which he was to shed for the re·
mission of our sins. But in'the present sacrifice, there isa
