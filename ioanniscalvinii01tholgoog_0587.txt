“ Divide it among yourselves.'' (o) History informs us, that
leavencd and common bread was used before the time of Alex-
ander, bishop of Rome, who was the first advocate for unleav·

dazzle the eyes of the people with admiration of a new specta·

peal to all who feel the least concern for piety, whether they do
not clearly perceive, how much more conspicuously the glory
of God appears in this use of the sacrament, and how much
greater abundance of spiritual consolation and delight be·
lievers enjoy in it, than in those insignificant and theatrical
fooleries which only tend to deceive the minds of the gazing
multitude. This they call keeping tho people in religion, when
they lead them into any thing they please, under the stupefac-
tion aud infatuation of superstition. If any one be inclined to
defend such inventions by the plen of antiquity, 1 arn equally
aware how early chrism and exorcism were used in baptism,
end how soon aller the age of the apostles, corruptions were
introduced into the Lord’s supper; but this is the confidence of
human presumption, which can never restrain itself from trifling
with the mysteries of God. But lct us remember, that God
holds the obedience of his word in such high estimation, that it
is the standard by which he appoints us to judge even his angels
and the whole world. Now, leaving all this mass of ceremonias,
let us remark, that the Lord’s supper might be most properly
administered, ifit were set before the Ohurch very frequently,
and at least once in every week in the following manner: The
service should commence with public prayer, in the next place,
a sermon should be delivered; then, the bread and wine being
placed upon the table, the minister should recite the institution
of the supper, should declare the promises which are left to
us in it, and, at the same time, should excommunicate all those
who are excluded from it by the prohibition of the Lord3 after
this, prayer should be offered, that with the same benignity
with which our Lord has given us this sacred food, he would
also teach and enable us to receive it in ·faith and gratitudo of
heart, and that, as of ourselves we are not worthy, he would, ,
in his mercy, make ns worthy of such a feast. Then either

some psalms should be sung, or a portion of Scriptura should
be read, arrd believers, in a becoming order, should participate
of the sacred banquet, the ministers breaking the bread and
distributing it, and presenting the cup, to the people3 after the
conclusion of the supper, an exhortation should be given to
sincere saith, and a confession of the same3 to charity, and a
