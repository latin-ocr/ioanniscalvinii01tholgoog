declares that it is unlewful for a thing formed to quarrel with
its maker. (r) Now, how will those, who admit not that any
are reprobated by God, evade this declaration of Christ: “ Every
plant which my heavenly F'ather hath not planted, shall be
rooted up? '³ (y) Upon all whom our heavenly Father has not
deigned to plant as sacred trees in his garden, they hear de·
struction plainly denounced. If they deuy this to be a sign of
reprobation, there is nothing so clear as to be capable of proof
to such persons. But if they cease not their clamour, let the
sobriety of faith be satisfied with this admonition of Paul, that
there is no cause for quarrelling with God, is, on the one hand,
willing to show his wrath, and to make his power known, he
endures, “with much long-suffering, tha vessels of wrath
fitted to destnrction ; '² and on the other, makes “known the
riches of his glory on the vessels of meroy, whom he had afore

supreme domiirion to the wrath and power of Gitd3 because it
is unreasonable for those deep judgments, which absorb all our
· faculties, to be called in question by us. lt is a frivolous reply
of our adversaries, that God does not wholly reject the objects
of his long-suffering, but remeius in suspenso towards them,
awaiting the possibility of their repentance3 as though Paul
attributed patience to God, in expectation of the conversion
of those whom he asserts to be fitted to destruction. Por
Angustiae, in expounding this passage, where power is con·
nected with patience, justly observes, that God’s power is not
tutrttrulullltblt llttltlvttr‘ll litt
destruction, but that diod prepared the vessels of mercy; since
by this mode of expression, he ascribes and challenges to God
the praise of salvatiou, and throws the blame of perdition upon
those who by their choico procura it to themselves. But
though l concede to them, that Paul softens the asperity of the
former clause by the difference of phraseology, yet it is not at
all consistent to transfer the preparation for destruction to any
other than the secret counsel of God3 which is also asserted
just before in the context, that “ God raised up Pharaoh, and
whom he will he hardeneth.'’ Whence it follows, that the
cause of hardeniug is the secret counsel of God. This, however,
I maintain, which is observed by Augustine that when God
turns wolves into sheep, he renovates them by more powerful
grace to conquer their obduracy3 and therefore the obstinate
are not converted, because God exerts not that mightier grace,
of which he is not destitute, if he chose to display it.
