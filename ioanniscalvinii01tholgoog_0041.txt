Lar us now pursue the other arguments with which Satan by
his satellites attempta to destroy or to weaken justification by
saith. 1 think we have already gained this point with these
calumniatore-that they can no longer accuse us of being cne-
mies to good works. For we reject the notion oi justification
by works‚ not that no good works may be done, or that those
which are performed may be denied to be good, but that we
may neither confide in them, nor glory in thern, nor ascribe
salvation to them. For this is our trust, this is our glory, and
the only anchor of our salvation, That Christ the Son os God is
ours, and that we are likewise, in him, sons os God and heire
os the celestial kingdom3 being called, not sor our worthincas,
but by the Divina goodness, to the hope of ctemal felicity.
But since they assail us besides, as we have observed, with
other weapons, let us also proeced to the repulsion ol them.
In the first place, they return to the legal promises which the
Lord gave to the observers os his law, and inquire whether we

it sor granted that they have some efficacy. Hence they
argue, that we are not justified by saith alone. For thus saith
the Lord, “ Whercfore it shall corne to pass, if ye hearkcn to
these jndgments, and keep and do thern, that the Lord thy
God shall keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he
sware unto thy fathers 3 and he will love thee, and blesa thee,
and multiply thee.''(b) Again: “If ye thoronghly amend
your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judg·
ment between a man and his neighbour; if ye oppress not,
neither welk after other gods; then will I cause you to dwcll

sagos of the same kind, which, not being different in sense, will
be clucidated by an explanationes these. The snm of all is
declared by Moses, who says that in tho law are proposed “a
blessing and a curse, life and death.’' (d) Now, they argue,
either that this blessing becomes inefficacious end nugatory, or
that justification is not by saith alone. We have already
shown, how, iswe adhere to the law, being destitute of every
