they accompany the affectiones the beart. For they exercise
the mind in Divina meditation, and fix the attention os tlre
heart; which by its lubricity and versatility is easily relaxed
and distracted ιο a variety oi objects, unless it be supported by
various helps. Resides, as the glory of God ought in some
respect to be nranisested in every part of our bodies, to this
service, both in singing and in speaking, it becomes us espe-
cially to addict and devote our tongues, which were created for
the express purpose of declaring and celebrating the Divina
praises. Nevertheless the principal use ot‘ the tongne isin the
public prayers which are made in the congregations of be·
lievers3 the design of which is, that with one common voice,
and as it were with the same mouth, we may all at once pro·
claim the glory of God, whom we worship in one spirit aud
with tlre same saith; and this is publicly done, that all inter·
changeably, each one of his brother, may receive the confes·
sion of saith, and be invitcd and stimulated by his example.
XXXII. Now, the custom os singing in churches (to spealt
of it by the way) not only appears ιο be very ancient, but that
it was even used by the apostles, may bo concluded from these
words of Paul: “l will sing with the spirit, and 1 will sing
with the understanding also.'’(lr) Again, to the Colossinus:
“Teaching and admonishing one another in psalms, and
hymns, aud spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts
to the Lord.”· (ι’) For ιιι the former passage he inculcatas
singing with the voice and with the heart; and ru the latter he
recommends spiritual songs, which may conduce ιο the mutual
edificatiou ot* the saints. Yet that it was not universal is
proved by Augustine, who relatas that in the time of Ambrose,
the church at Milan first adopted the practice os singing, when,
during the persecution οι the orthodox saith by lustina, the
mother os Valentinian, the people were unusually assiduous in
their vigils; and that the other Western churches followed.
For he had just before mentioned that this custom had been
derived from the churches of the East. He signifies also, in
tlre second boolt os his Retractations, that in his time it was
received in Africa “One Hilary, (says he,) who held the
tribunitial office, took every opportunity of leading with ma·
licious censures the custom which was then introduced at Car-
thago, that hymns from the Book of Psalms should be sung at
the altar, either before the oblatiou, or while that which lrnd
been offered was distributed ιο the people. ln obedience to
the commands of my brethren, lanswered bim.'' And cer·
tainly if srnging be attempered to that gravity which becomes
the presence os God und of angels, it adds a dignity and grace
