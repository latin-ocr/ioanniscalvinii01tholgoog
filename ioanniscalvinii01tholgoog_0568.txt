kingdom of heaven! But it is essential to a real body, to have
its particular form and dimensions, and to be contained within
some certain space. Let us hear no more, then, of this ridicu-
lons notion‚ which fastens the minds of men, and Christ him-
self, to the bread. For· what is the use of this invisible pre-
sence concealed under the bread, but to lead those who desire
to be united to Christ, to confine their attention to that symboli
But the Lord intended to withdraw, not only our eyes, but all
our semes, from the earth, when he forbade the woman to
touch him, because he was not yet ascended to his Father. (m)
When he saw Mary, with pious affection and reverence, hasten·
ing to kiss his feet, there was no reason for his disapprobation
and prohibition of such an act, before his ascension to heaven,
except that heaven was the only place where he chose to be
sought. lt is objected, that he was afterwards seen by Ste-
phen ; (a) but the answer is easy; for, in order to this, no
change of place was necessary to Christ, who could impart to
the eyes of his servant a supernatural perspicacity, capable of
penetrating into heaven. The same observation is applicable
to his appearance to Paul. (o) They allege that Christ came
out of the sepulchre, while the sepulchre remained closed, and
entered into the room where his disciples were assembled,
while the doors continued shnt3 but this contributes no sup
port to their error. Foras the water was like a solid pavement‚
forming a road for Christ when he walked on the lake, so it
is no wonder if the harduess of the stone gave way, to make
him a passage3 though it is more probable that the stone re-
moved at his command, and after his departure returned to its
place. And to enter while the doors remained shut, does not
imply his penetrating through the solid matter, but his open·
ing an entrance for himself by his Divine power, so that, in a
miraculous manner, he instantaneously stood in the midst of
his disciples, though the doors were shut. What they adduce
from Luke‚ that “he vanished out of the sight '² of his two
disciples, with whom he had walked to Emmaus, (p) is of no
service to their cause, bnt is in favour of ours3 for, according
to the testimony of the same evangelist, when he joined these
disciples, he assumed no new appearance in order to conceal
himself 3 but “their eyes were holden, that they should not
know him.'' (q) Our adversaries, however, not only transform
Christ. to keep him in the world, but they represent him as
unlike nrmself, and altogether different on earth from what he
isin heaven. By such extravagances, in short, they tum the
body of Christ into a spirit, though not by positive assertion,
