thee the keys, as if the power of binding aud loosing had been
conferred upon him alone, whereas he made that answer ou
behalf of all, and received this power in common with all, as
sustaining the character 01 unity. He is mentioned, therefore,
one 101 all, because there is unity in all.’'

V. But this declaration, “Thou art Peter, and upon this
rock I will build my Church,'’ (α) they say, is no where to be
found addressed 10 any other. As if in this passage Christ
affirmed any thing respecting Peter, different from what Paul,
and even Peter himself, asserta, respecting all Christiana. For
Paul makes “Christ the chief corner-stone,” upon which they
are built who “ grew unto a holy temple in the lord.'’(b)
And Peter eujoins usto be “as lively stenes,” who, being
founded on that “ corner-stone, elect aud precious,” (0) are by
this connection at once united to our God and to each 011101.
This belongs to Peter, they say, above the rest, because it is
expressly attributed to him in particular. l readily allow
Peter the honour of being placed among the first in the struc-
ture of the Oburcb, or, 11 they insist upon it, the very first of
all 1110 faithful ; but 1 will not permit them to infer from this that
he possessed a primacy over the rest. For what kind ss rea-
soniug is this: he excels the rest iu ardour of zeal, in doctrine,
in magnanimity 3 therefore 110 possessas authority over them?
As though we might not with greater plausibility conclude
that Andrew was superior to Peter, because he preceded him
intime, and introduced him to Christ; (d) but this Ι pass over.
1 am willing thet Peter should have the precedeuce, but there
isagreat difference between the honour 01 preceding others,
and authority over them. We see that the apostles generally
paid this deference to Peter, that he used to speak first in their
assembly, and took the lead in proposing, exhorting, and ad-
monishiug3 but we read not aword of his power.

Vl. We are not yet, however, come to that question ; lonly
mean at present to 111011, that they have no solid argument, when
they wish to erect au empire over the universal church upon no
other foundation thau the name of Peter. For those antiquated
fooleries with which they endeavoured at first 10 impose on tbe
world, are not worthy of a relation, much less of a refutation -
that the Ohurch was founded on Peter, because it is said, “Upon
this rock l will build my Church.'’ (e) They allega in their
defence, that it hasbeen so explained by some 01 the fathers.
But when this is contradicted by the whole 10110101 Scripture,
what avails it 10 set up their authority in opposition to God?
And why do we disputa about 1110 meaning of those words, as
though they were ambiguous 01 obscure? whereas nothing cau
