any truth. But the design of the apostle was to represent
the ceremonial law as of no value till it was referred to Christ,
on whom alone depended all its efficacy.

XXIV. But they will allege what Paul says of the “cir-
cumcision in the letter,” (n) that it is in no estimation with
God; that it confers no advantage, that it is in vain, for such
llll‘ilels‘l‘ssllrllel tssflllllhla'tltllallt'llallgl
justly be affirmed of baptism. And it is actually asserted ; first
by Paul himself, where he shows that God regards not the ex-
ternal ablution by which we enter on the profession of religion,
unless the heart be purified within, and persevere in piety to
the end; and, secondly, by Peter, when he declares the truth
of baptism to consist‚ not in “the putting away of the filth of
the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience.'’ (o) It will be
objected, that Paul seems in another place utterly to despise
“the circumcision made with hands,'' when he compares it
with “the circumcision of Christ.'’ (p) 1 reply, that that
passage derogates nothing from its dignity. Paul is there dis·
puting against those who required it as still necessary, after it
had been abrogated. He therefore admonishes believers to
leave the ancient shadows, and adhcre to the nuth. These
teachers, he says, urge you to be circumcised in your bodies.
But you have been spiritually circumcised both in body and
soul: you have the substance itself, therefore, which is better
than the shadow. Some one might object to this, that the
figura was not to be despised in consequence of their having
the substance; for that the fathers under the Old Testameut
had experienced the circumcision of the heart, and the putting
off of the old man, of which the apostle was speaking, and yet
that extemal circumcision had not been unnecessary or useless
to them. He anticipatos and supersedes this objection, by im-
mediately adding, that the Colossians had been “buried with
Christ in baptism ; ’' by which he significa that baptism is to
Christiana what circumcision was to the ancient believers‚ and
consequently that circumcision cannot be imposed upon Christ·
ians without injury to baptism.

XXV. But our objectors proceed to allega, that a still

5 stronger argument in their favour arises from what follows,
which 1 have lately quoted, -that all the Jewish ceremonias
were “a shadow of things to come, but the body is of
Christ ; ’⁵ (q) and that the strongest argument of all is what is
contained in the Epistle to the Hebrews, that the blood of
beasts did not reach the conscience, that “the law ’² had “a
shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the
