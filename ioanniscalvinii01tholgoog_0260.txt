them from each other: “ He that is ofGod, heareth God’s words 3
ye therefore hear them not, because ye are not of God.’' (r)
ln fine, as the Church is the kingdom of Christ, and he reigns
only by his word, can any person doubt the falsehood of those
pratensions, which represent the kingdom of Christ as destitute
of his sceptra, that is, of his holy word?

V. With respect to the charge which they bring against us of
heresy and schism, because we preach a different doctrine from
theirs, and submit not to their laws, and hold separate as·
semblies for prayers, for baptism, for the administration of the
Lord’s supper, and other sacred exercises, it is indeed a most
heavy accusation, but such as by no means requires a long or la·
borious defence. The appellatione of heretics and schismatica
are applied to persons who cause dissension, and destroy the com·
munion of the Church. Now, this communion is preserved by
two bonds - agreement in sonnd doctrine, and brotherly love.
Between heretica and schismatics, therefore, Augustine makes
the following distinction - that the former corrupt the purity of
the faith by false doctrines, and that the latter break the bond
of affection, sometimes even while they retain the same saith.
But it is also to be remarked, that this union of affection is
dependent on the unity of faith, as its foundation, end, and rula.
Let ns remember, therefore, that, whenever the unity of the
Church is enjoined upon us in the Scripture, it is required,
that, while our minds hold the same doctrines in Christ, our
wills should likewise be united in mutual benevolence in Christ.
Therefore, Paul, when he exhorta us to it, assumes as a founda-
tion, that there is “ one Lord, one faith, and one baptism.'’ (a)
And when he inculcates our being “like-minded, and having
the same love, being of one accord, of one mind‚'’ (t) he im·
mediately adds, that this should be in Christ, or according to
Christ; signifying that all union which is formed without the

word of the Lord, is a faction of the impious, and not an asso-
ciation of believers.

Vl. Cyprian, also, after the example of Paul, deduces the
origin of all ecclesiastical concord from the supreme bishopric
of Christ. He afterwards subjoins, “ There is but one Church,
which is widely extended into a multitude by the offspring of
its fertility3 just as there are many rays of the sun, but the
light is one; and a tree has many branches, but only one trunlr,
sured on a firm root. And when many rivers issue from one
source, though by its exuberant abundance the stream is mul·
tiplied into numerous cunents, yet the unity of the fountain
still remains. Separate a ray from the body of the sun, and ita
unity suctains no division. Brealr off a branch from a tree, and
the broken branch can never bnd. Cut off ariter from the
