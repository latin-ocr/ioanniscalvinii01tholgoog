boldly to the throne of grace, that we may find grace ; ” (p)
and informs us, that “ we have boldness and access, with con·
fidenae, by the saith of Christ.” (q) This assurance os obtaining
what we implore, therefore, which is both commanded by the
Lord himself, and taught by the example of the saints, it be-
comesus to hold fast with all our might, if we would pray to
any good purpose. For that prayer alone is accepted by God,
which arises (if I may use the expression) from such a pre·
sumptiou of saith, and is founded on an undaunted assrnance
of hope. He might, indeed, have contented himself with the
simple mention of “ saith 3 '’ yet he has not only added “ con·
fidence,'' but fumished that confidence with liberty or “ bold·
ness,'' to distinguish by this criterion between us and nube
lievers, who do indeed pray to God in common with us, but
entirely at an uncertainty. For which reason, the whole
Chnrch prays in the psalm, “Let thy mercy, 0 Lord, be
upon us, according as we hope in thee.” (r) The Psalmist
elsewhere introduces the same idea: “This I know3 for God
is for me.'’(s) Again: “In the morning will 1 direct rny
prayer unto thee, and will look up.” (t) For from these words
we gether, that prayers are but empty sounds, if nnattended
by hope, from which, as from a watehtower, we quietly look
out for God. With which correspouds the order of Paul’s ex·
hortati0n; for before exhorting believers to “ pray always with
all prayer and supplication in the Spirit,” he first directs them
to “ take the shield of saith, the helmet of salvation, and the
sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.” (u) Now, let
the reader recollect, what l have before asserted, that faitb is
not at all weakeued by being connected with an acknowledg-
ment of our misery, poverty, and impurity. For believers feel
themselves oppressed by a grievous load of sins, while destitute
of every thing which could conciliate the favour of God, and
burdened with much guilt, which might justly render him an
object of their dread3 yet they casse not to present themselves
before him; nor does this expericnce terrify them from resort·
ing to him, since there is no other way of access to him. For
prayer was instituted, not that we might arrogantly exalt our-
selves in the presence of God, or form a high opinion os any
thing of our own ; but that we might confess our guilt to him,
and deplora our miserias with the familiarity of children con·
fiding their complaints to their parents. 'l'he immense accu-
mulation of our distresses should operate as so many incite-
ments to. urge us to pray3 as we are taught likewise by tha
example of the Psalmist: “ Heal my scol, for l have sinned
