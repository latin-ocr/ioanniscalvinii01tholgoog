And this impositiou of hands is mentioned by the sacred histo·
rian on several occasions. l perceive what the apostles did -
that they faitbsully executed their ministry. It was the Lord's
will, that those visible and wonderful graces of the Holy spirit,
which he then poured out upon his people, should be ad·
ministered and distributed by his apostles with imposition os
hands Now, I do not conceive that the impositiones hands
concealed any higher mystery‚ butam of opinion that this
ceremony was employed by them asan external expression
os their commending, and, as it were, presenting to God, the
person upon whom they laid their hands. ls the ministry
which was theu executed by the apostles were still continued
in the Church, imposition os hands ought also to be still ob-
served; but since such grace is no longer conferred, of what use
is the imposition os hands? lt is true that the people of God
still enjoy the presence os the Holy Spirit, whose guidance
and directiou are indispensable to the existence os the Ohurch.
For we have the eternal promise, which can never sail, aud in
which Christ has said, “ls any man thirst, let him come unto
me, and drink living water.” (m) But those miraculous powers
and manifest operations, which were distributed by imposition
os hands, have caused, and it was right that they should con·
tinue but sora time. For it was necessary that the first
preaching os the gospel‚ and the kingdom os Christ, at its com-
mencement, should be illustrated and magnified by miracles
never seen or heard before3 the subsequent cessation os which
does not argue the Lord’s desertion of his Ohurch, but is equi-
valent to a declaration from him that the magnificeuce os his
reign and the dignity of his word had been sufficiently mani·
fested. ln what respect, theu, will these impostore affirm that
they imitate the apostles? They should have effected, by
imposition os hands, that the evident power of the Spirit might
immediately show itself. This they do not practise. Why,
then, do they boast that they are countenanced by the imposi-
tion of hands, which we find was used by the apostles, but sor
a totally different purpose.

Vll. This is just as reasonable as it would be sor any oue
to affirm the afflation, with which the Lord breathed upon his
disciples, to be a sacrament by which the Holy Spirit is con-
serred. (n) But though the Lord did this once, he has never
directed it to be done by us. In the same manner, the apostles
practised imposition of hands during that period in which the
Lord was pleased to dispenso the visible graces os the Holy
Spirit in compliance with their prayers3 not in order that
persons in succeeding times might counterfeit a vain and useless
sign, as a mere piece os mimicry destitute of any reality. Be·
