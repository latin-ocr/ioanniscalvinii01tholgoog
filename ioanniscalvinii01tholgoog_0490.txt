blood, because our merciful Father, in his incomparable good·
nass, being pleased to receive us to his mercy, has appointed
this Mediator between us, to conciliate his favour tous. But
we receive regeneration from his death and resurrection, when
we are endued with a new and spiritual nature by the sanctifi·
cation of the Spirit. Of our purification and regeneration,
therefore, we obtain, and distinctly perceive, the cause in the
Father, the matter iri the Son, and the efficaoy in the Spirit.
Thus John first, and the apostles afterwards, baptized “ with
tlie baptismos repentance for the remissiori of sins ; ” ( f ) by
repentance, intending regeneration, aud by remissiore os sins,
ablution.

vii. Hence also it is very certain that the ministry of John
was precisely the same as that which was afterwards committed
to the apostles. For their baptism was not different, though it
was administered by different hands; but the sameness of their
doctrine shows their baptism to have been the same. John and
the apostles agreed in the same doctrine ς both baptized to
repentance, both to remissiori of sins; both baptized in the
name of Christ, from whom repentance and remissiori of sins
proceed. John said of Christ, “Behold the Lamb of God,
which taketh away the sin of the world; '' (g) thus acknow·
ledging and declaring him to be the sacrifice acceptable to the
Fathcr, the procurer of righteousness, and the author of sal·
vation. What could the apostles add to this confession?
Wherefore let no one be disturbed by the attempts of the
ancient writers to distinguish and separate one baptism from
the other; for their authority ought not to have weight enough
to shake our confidence in the Scriptura. For who will attend
to chrysostom, who denies that remissiori of sins was included
in the baptism of John, rather than to Luke, who, on the
contrary, affirma that “John came preaching the baptism of
repentance, for the remissiori of sinsl” (t) Nor must we
admit that subtlety of Augustine, “that in the baptism of John
sins were remitted in hope, but in the baptism of Christ they
were remitted iii fact.'' For as the evangelist clearly testifies
that John, in liis baptism, promised the remissiori of sins, why
should we diminish this commendation, when no necessity
constrains us to it? But if any difference be sought for in the
word of God, the only difference that will be found is, that John
baptized in the name of him who was to come, the apostles in
the name of him who had already manifested himself.

viii. The more abundant effusion of the graces of the
Spirit, after the resurrection of Christ, contributas nothing to
