formerly he was not content with the written law, but appoint-
ed the priests as interpretem, at whose lips the people might
inquire its true meaning, so, in the present day, he not only
requires us to be attentive to reading, but bas appointed teach-
ers sor our assistance. This is attended with a twot‘old
advantage. For on the one hand, it is a good proot' of our
obedienoe when we listen to his ministare, just as is he were
addressing us himself3 and on the other, he has provided for
our infirmity, by ohoosing to address us through the medium
of human interpreters, that he may sweetly allure us to him,
rather thau to drive us away from him by his thunders. And
the propriety of this familiar manner oi teaching‚ is evideut to
all the pious, from the terror with which the majesty of God
justly alarms them. Those who consider the authority os the
doctrine as wealrened by the meanness of the men who are called
to teach it, betray their ingratitude; because among so many
excellent gifts with which God has adorned mankind, it is a
peculiar privilege, that hc deigus to consecrate men’s lips and
tongues to his service, that his voice may be heard in thern.
Let us not therefore, on our parts, be reluctant to receive and
obey the doctrine os salvation proposed to us athis express
command; for though the power of God is not confined to ex·
ternal means, yet be has confined us to tha ordinary manner
of teaching‚ the fanatical rejecters os which necessarily involve
themselves in many fatal suares. Many are urged by pride,
or disdain, or envy, to persuade themselves that they can profit
sufficiently by reading and meditating in private, and so to
despise public assemblies, and consider preaohing as unneces·
sary. But since they do all in their power to dissolve and
break asunder the bond os unity, whieh ought to be preserved
inviolable, not one oi them escapes the just punishment oi this
impious bruach, but they all involve themselves in pestilent
errors and peruicious reverias. Wherefore, in order that the
pure simplicity of saith may flourish among us, let us not be
reluctant to use this exercise of piety, which the Divina insti·
tntion has shown to be necessary, and which God so repeatedly

commende to us. There has never been found, among the .

most extravagantes mortals‚ one insolent enough to say that
we ought to shut our ears against God, but the propheta and
pious teachers, in all ages, have had a difficult contest with
the wicked, whose arrogance can never submit to be taught
by the lips and ministry of men. Now, this is no other
than effacing the irnage of God, which is discovered to usin
