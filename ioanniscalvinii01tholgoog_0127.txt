valucd by us, since the only begotten Sonos God puts words
into our mouths, which may deliver our minds from all hesi·
tation.

XXXV. This form or rule ot‘ prayer, whichever appellation
be given to it, is composed os six petitions. For my reason sor
not agreeing with those who divide it into seven parts is, that
the Evangelist appears, by the insertion os tha adversative con-
junction, to connect together these two clauses, as though he
had said, Suffer us not to be oppressed with temptation, but
rather saccom our weakness, and deliver us, that we may not
fall. The ancient writers os the Ohurch also are of our
opinion; so that what is now added in Matthew in the seventh
place, must be explained as belonging ιο the sixth petition.
Now, though the whole prayer is such, that in every partos it
the principal regard must be paid to the glory of God, yet ιο
this the first three petitions are particularly devoted, and ιο
this alone we ought ιο attend in them, without any consider·
ation os our own interest. 'l'he remaining three concern our·
selvas, and are expressly assigned to supplicatione sor those
things which tend to our benefit. As when we pray that
God’s name may ba hallowed, since he chooses to prove
whether our love and worship os him be voluntary, or dictated
by mercenary motivas, we must then think nothing of our
own interest, but his glory must be proposed aa the only object
of our fixed attention; nor is it lawful sor us to be differently
affected in the other petitions os this class. And this indeed
conducas ιο our great benefit3 because, when the Divine name
is hallowed or sanctified as we pray, it becomes lihewise our
sanctification. But our eyes should overlook, and be, as it ware,
blind ιο such advantage, so as not to pay the least regard to it.
And even if we were deprived of all hope os private benefit, yet
this hallowing, and the other things which pertain to the glory
os God, ought still ιο be the objacts of our desires andos our
prayers. This is conspicuous in the examples of Moses and
Paul, (p) who felt a pleasure in averting their minds and eyes
from themselves, and in praying with vehement and ardent zeal
for their own destruction, that they might promote the king-
dom and glory os God even at the expense of their own happi-
ness. On tha other hand, when we pray that our daily bread
may be given us, although we wish sor what is beneficial ιο
ourselves, yet here also we ought principally ιο aim at tho glory
of God, so as not even to ask it, unless it tend to his glory.
Now, let us attempt an explanation os tha prayer itsels.
