grant them, provided it be rightly explained. But why do they
not consider the numerous passages where, by the assumption
of human affections, God condescends beneath his own majesty?
He says, “ Ι have spread out my hands all the day unto a re·
bellicus people3 '’ (b) early and late endeavouring to bring them
ιο himself. If they are determined to accommodate all this to
God, and disregard the figurative mode of expression, they will
give rise to many needless contentions, which may be settled by
this one solution, that what is peculiar to man is transferred to
God. The solution, however, elsewhere stated by us, is fully
sufficient -that though to our apprehension the will of God is
manifold and various, yet he does not in himself will things at
variance with each other, but astonishes our faculties with his
various and “ manifold wisdom,'’ according to the expression of
Paul, till we shall be enabled ιο understand, that hc mysteri·
ously wille what now seems contrary to his will. They im·
pertinently object, that God being the Father of all, it is unjust
for him to disinherit any but such as have previously deserved
this punishment by their own guilt. As if the goodness of God
did not extend even to dogs and swine. But if the question
relatas to the human race, let them answer why God allied
himself to one people aa their Father3 why he gathered even
from them but a very small number, as the flower of them.

world.’' (d) They further object, tbat God hates nothing he has
made 3 which though Ι grant them, the doctrine l maintain still

that most justly, because, being destitute of his Spirit, they can
do nothing but what isdeserving of hiscurse. 'l'hey further al·

of Paul, that God calls whom he pleases, both of the Jews and
of the Gentiles, (e) so that hc is underno obligation to any. In
this way also we answer their arguments from another text,
which says, that “God bath concluded them all in unbelief,
