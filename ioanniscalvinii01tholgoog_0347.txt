the pious readers, that whatever is asserted respecting the power
of the Church, they should be mindful to refer to the end sor
which Paul declares it to have been given, namely, “to edili·
cation, and not to destruction ; '’ (s) and all who make a legiti-
mate use 01¹ it, consider themselves as nothing more than
“servants of Christ,'’ (g) and the people’s “ servants sor Jesus'
sake.’' (lr) Now, the only way to edisy the Church is, t'or the
ministers themselves to study to preserve to Jesus Christ his
rightsul authority, which can no longer be secure than while
he is lest in possession os what he has received from the Father,
that is, to be the sole Mastcr in the Church. (i) For of him
alone, and os no other‚is it said, “Hear ye him.''(lc) The

extended in every directioyn, according tii, the caprice os men.
lt will, therefore, be highly useful to observe how it is described
by the prophete and apostles. Foris we simply grant to men
the power which they may be pleased to assume, it must be
obvious to every one, what adcor will be opened sor tyranny,
which ought never to be seen in the Church os Christ.

11. Here, therefore, itis necessary to remember, that what·
aver authority and dignity is attributed by the Holy Spirit, in
the Scriptura, either to the priests and propheta under the law,
or to the apostles and their successors, it is ell given, notin a
strict sense to the persons themselves, but to the ministry over
which they were appointed, or, to spealr more correctly, to the
word, the ministration os which was committed to thern. For
it we examine thern all in0succession, we shall not find that
they were invested with any authority to teach or to answer
inquiries, but in the name and word of the Lord. For when
they were called to their office, it was at the same time en·
joined that they should bring sorward nothing os themselves,
but should spealr from the mouth ot' the Lord. Nor did he
send thern forth in public to address the people, belore he had
instmcted them what they should say, that they might spcalr
nothing beside his word. Moses himself, the prince os all the
propheta, was to be heard above all others3 but he was first fur·
nished with his commission, that he might not be able to an-
nounce any thing except from the Lord. Theresore the people,
when they received his doctrine, were said to “believe the
Lord and his servant Moses.'’ (l) 'l'he authority os the priests
also, that it might not fall into contempt, was confirmed by the
severest punishments. (m) But, on the other hand, the Lord
shows on what condition they were to be heard, when he says,
