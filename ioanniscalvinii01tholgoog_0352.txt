us? lt is rather necessary that the mouths of all men should
be shut, since he has once spoken, in whom it has pleased tho
heavenly Father that all the treasures of wisdom and know·
ledge should ba hidden, (e) and has spoken in amanuer becom-
ing the wisdom of God, in which there is no imperfectiou, and
the Messiah‚ who was expected to reveal all things ; (s) that
is, has spoken in such a manner as to leave nothing to be said
by others after him.

Vlll. Let us lay down this, then, as an undoubted axiom,
that nothing ought to be admitted in the Church as the word
of God, but what is contained first in the law and the pmphets,
and secondly in the writings of the spondes, and that there is
no other method of teaching aright in the Church than accord·
ing to the direction and standard of that word. Hence wa
conclude, also, that the apostles were allowed no more discre-
tion than the prophets before them—namely, to expound the
ancient Scriptura, aud to show that the things delivered init
were accomplished in Christ; but this they were only todo
from the Lord, that is to say, under the guidance and dictation
of tha Spirit of Christ. For Christ limited their mission by
this condition, when he ordered them to go and teach, not tha
fabricatione of their own presumption, but whatsoever he had
commanded them. (g) And nothing could be mora explicit
than what he saldon another occasion: “Be not ye called
Rabbi3 for one is your Master, even Christ.''(h) 'ro fix this
more deeply in their minds, he repeats it twice in the sams
place. Aud because their weakness was such that they were
unable to compreheud the things which they had heard and
learned from the lips of their Master, the Spirit of tmth was
promised to them, to lead them into the true understauding of
all things. (i) Forthat restrictiori is to ba attentively ramarked,

which assigns to the Holy Spirit the office of suggesting to

their hminds all that Christ had before taught them with his
mout .

IX. Therefore Peter, who had been fully taught by his
Master how far his office emended, represents nothingus left
for himself or others, but to dispensa the doctrine committed
to them by God. “If any man speak,'’ says he, “let him
speak as the oracles of God3 ’' (lc) that is, not with hesitation
or uncertainty, like persons conscious of no sufficient authority,
but with the noble confidence which becomes a servant of
God furnished with his certain commission. What is this but
