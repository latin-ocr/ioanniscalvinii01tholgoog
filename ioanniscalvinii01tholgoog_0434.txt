sasting‚ and imagine it to be the legitimate service of God. I
say nothing os the base gluttony practised at that season, more
than at any other time, by those who wish to pass sor the
greatest saints. In short they esteem it the highest worship
ol God to abstain from animal sood, and with this exception,
to indulge themselves in every kind of dainties. On the other
hand, to taste the least morsel os bacon or salted meat and
brown bread, they deem an actos the vilest impiety, and da·
sarving os worse than death. Jerome relatas, that there were
some persons, even in his time, who trilled with God by such
fooleries3 who, to avoid making use os oil, procured the most
delicate kinds of food to be brought from every country, and
who, to do violence to nature, abstained srom drinking water,
but procured delicious and costly liquors to be made sor them,
which they drank, not from a cup, but srom a shell. What
was then the vice os a few, is now become common among all
wealthy persons, they fast sor no other purpose than to feast
with more than common sumptuousness and delicacy. Butl
have no inclination to waste many words on a thing so notori-
ous. 1 only essert, that neither in their fastiugs, nor in any
other parts os their discipline, have the Papists any thing so
correct, sincere, or well regulated‚ as to have the least occasion
to pride themselves upon any thing being left among them
worthy os praise.

XXII. There remains the second partos the discipline ot'
the Ohurch, which particularly relatas to the clergy. It is con·
tained in the canons which the ancient bishops imposed on
themselves and their order ; such as these: That no ecclesias·
tic should employ his time in hunting, gambling, or feasting3
that no one should engage in usury or commarca, that no one
should be present at dissolute (lances, and other similar injunc-
tions. Penalties were likewise annexed, to confirm the authority
ot' the canons, and to prevent their being violated with impunity.
For this end, to every bishop was committed the govemment os
his clergy, to rule them according to the canons, and to oblige
them to do their duty. For this purpose were instituted annual
visitations and synods, that il any one were negligent in his
duty, he might be admonished, and that any one who commit·
ted a fault might be corrected according to his offense. The
bishops also had their provincial councils, once every year, and
anciently even twice a year, by which they were judged, is
they had commrtted any breach of their duty. For if a bishop
was too severe or violent against his clergy, there was a right of
appeal to the provincial councils, even though there was only a
single complainaut. The severest punishment was the deposi-
tion of the offender from his office, and his exclusion sor a time
from the communion. And because this wasa perpetual regula·
