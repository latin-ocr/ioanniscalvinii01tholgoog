himself: “Christian mon ιιι their prayers mutually recommend
each other ιο the Divina regard. That person, sor whom no
one intercades, while he intercedas for all, is the true and only Me·
diator. The apostle Paul, though a principal member under the
Head, yet because he wasa member of the body os Christ, and
knew the great and true High Priest of the Church had entered,
ιιοι typically, into the recesses within the veil, the holy of holies,
but truly and really into the interior recesses of heaven, iuto a
sanctuary not emblematical, but eternal, -Panl, I say, recom-
mends himself to the prayers of believers. Neither does he ’
make himself a mediator between God and the people, but ex·
horts all the members of the body of Christ mutually ιο pray for
one another3 since the members have a mutual solicitude for
each other; and if ona member suffers, the rest sympathize with
it. And so should the mutual prayers of all the members, who
are still engaged in the labours of the present state, ascend on
each other’s behalf to the Head, who is gone before them into
heaven, and who is the propitiation for our sins. For if Paul
were a mediator, the other apoetles would likewise sustain the
same character3 and so there would be many mediators3 and
Paul’s argument could not be supported, when he says, ‘For
there is one God, and one Mediator between God and men, the
man Christ Jesus; in whom we also are one, if we keep the
unity of the Spirit in the bond os peace! '’ Again, in another
place: “ But if you seek a priest, he is above the heavens, where
he now intercedas for you, who died for you on earth.’' Yet
we do not dream that he intercades for us in suppliant prostra-
tion at the Fathcr’s feet, but we apprehend, with the apostle,
that he appears in the presence of God sor us in such a manner,
that the virtue of his death avails as a perpetual intercession
sor us ; yet so as that, being entered into the heavenly sanctuary,
he continually, till the consummation of all things, presents to
God the prayers of his people, who remeia, as it were, at a dis·
tance in the court.

XXI. With respect ιο the saints who are dead in the dash,
but live ιιι Christ, if we attribute any intercession to them, let
us not imagine that they have any other way of praying to God
than by Christ, who is the only way, or that their prayers are
accepted by God in any other name. Therefore, since the Scrip-
ture calls us away from all others to Christ alone, — since it is
the will of our heavenly Father ιο gether together all things in
him, — ιι would be a proof os great stupidity, not to say insanity,
to be so desirous of procuring an admission by the saints, as to
be seduced from him, without whom they have no access them-
selves. But that this has been practised in some ages, and is
now practised wherever Popery prevails, who can deny ? Their
merits are frequently obtruded ιο conciliate the Divina favour ;
