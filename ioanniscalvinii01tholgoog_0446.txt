world has long been indamed, examii-led according ιο the rules
which we have laid down, will not only be found to be vain
and nugatory, but replete with manifest impiety. For whatever
may be the judgment us the flosh, God holds nothing in greater
abomination than services es human invention* The following
pernicious aud execrable opinions ase also entertained5 hypo-
crines, when they have performed these sooleries, suppose
themselves to have auaiued a high degree os righieousness3
they place the whole substance os piety in external obser-
vanoes3 and they despise all who discover less concern about
these things than themselves.

vm. Το enumerate all the particular kinds of vows, would
answer no good purpose. But, because monastic vows are held
in very high veneratiou, as they seemed to be sanetioued by the
publia authority os the Chureh, it is proper to make a few
brief remarks respecting thern. ln the first place, that no one
may defend monachism, es it exists in the present day, under
the pretence os ancient and long-continued proscriptioni, it must
be observed, that the mode os lise in monasteries, in ancient
times, was very different from what it is now. They were the
retreats os those who wished to habituate themselves to the
greatest austerity and patience ς sor the discipline attributed to
the Lacedaemoniam, under the laws os Lyeurgus, was equalled,
and even considerably exeeeded in rigour, by thet which was
then promised among the monks. They slept on the ground
without any beds or couehes; they drank nothing but water;
their sood consisted entirely os breed, herba, and roots; their
principa] daiuties were oil, peasa, and beans. They abstained
from all delieecy os vietuals and ema-ments os the body. These
things might be thought incredible, if they were not attested
by persons who saw aad experienced theruy Gregory of Nazian-

discipline that they prepared themselves sor higher offiees. For
that the monastic colleges were at that tiu-ie the seminarius,
from which the Churoh was sszrnished with minimus, is suffi-
eiently evident from the examples of those whom we have
mentioned, who were all educated in monasteriesy and rrum
that situation were called to the episcopal office, as well es us
many other great and excellent men os their age. And Augus-
tine shows thet the sauia eustorn os supplying ministers sor the
Church from the monasteria continued iu his tirne; for the
monks os the leland os Capraria are addressed by him in the
following manner: “We exhort you in tho Lord, brethren,
that you keep your purposey and persovere tq the end3 and
