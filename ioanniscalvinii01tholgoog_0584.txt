as to pollute and profane it. And as,arnidst their dissension
and alienation from their brethren, they presumo ιο mingle the
sacred symbol of Christ's body with their discordo, it is not
owing to them that the body of Christ is not divided, and every
member severed from the rest. Therefore they are justly
represented as guilty of the body end blood ol the Lord,
which they so shamesully polluto with their sacrilegious im·
piety. By this unworthy eating they receive tlieir own con·
demnation. Fer though they have no faith lixed on Christ,
yet in their reception of tho sacrament they profess that theroio
no salvation for them any where except in him, and renounce
every other dependence. Whereforo they are their own ac·
ousers; they give testimony against themselves ; they seal their
own condemnation. Moreover, while divided and distracted
from their brethren, that is, from the members of Christ, they

salvation is ιο participate of Christ, and ιο be united to him.

Christ, he is ready to devoto himself to his brethren, and to com·
municate himself te thom with whom ho has a common interest
in Christ 3 whether, as he himself is acknowledgod by Christ, he
in lilre manner considers all his brethren es members of his
body ; whether he desires to cherish, preserve, and assist them
as his own members. Not that these duties of saith and charity
can now be perfect in us3 but because this is the point which
we ought to feel the most ardent desires and exert the most
strenuous efforts to attain, that our seith maybe more and more
increased, and our charity strengthened from day to day.

ΧΗ. ln general, when they have intended to prepare pen
sons for this worthy participation of the sacrament, they have
dreadhrlly herassed and tortured miserablo consciences, and
yet have not mentioned a single thing which tho case required.
They have said that those “eat worthily,” who are in a stato
of grace. Το be in a stato of grace, they have explained ιο

which would exclude all the men who now live, or ever have
lived upon earth, from the benefit of this sacrament. For if it
