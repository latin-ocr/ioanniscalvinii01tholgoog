controversies. But because Leo saw that it would be too pre·

sumptuous a demand to require the first place for his legates,
therefore he waived it.

ΙΙ. Next follows the Couueil of Chalcedon, in which, by the
permission of the emperor, the legates of the Roman Church
occupied the first place. But Leo himselfconfessed that this was
an extraordinary privilege. For when he requested it from
Marcion the emperor, and Pulcheria the cmpress, he did not
pretend it to be his right, but only alleged, in support of his
claim, that the Eastem bishops who presided in the Council of
Ephesus had thrown every thing into confusion, and abused
their power. Since it was necessary, therefore, to have a dis-
creet moderator, and it was improbable that those who had once
been so unsteady and disorderly would be fit for the office, he
requested that, on account of the miscouduct and incompeteuce
of the others, the task of presiding should be transferred to him.
That which is sought as a special privilege and an exception to
a common custom, certainly does not arise from a general rule.
Where the only pretext is, that it was necessary to have a new
president, because the former oues had violated their duty, it is
evident that this had not been the case before, and it ought not to
be perpetual, but was merely done in the contemplation of
present danger. 'Phe bishop of Rome, therefore, had the first
place in the Oouacil of Chalcedon, not because it was the right
of his see, but because the eouncil was in want of adiscreet
and suitable president, in consequence of those to whom that
honour belonged having excluded themselves from it by their
own intemperauce and violence. And what I say was proved,
in fact, by Leo's successor. For when he sent his legates to
the fifth Council of Constantinople, which was held a considera·
ble time after, he contended not for the first seat, but without
any difficulty suffered it to be talren by Manna, patriarch of
Constantinople. So in the Council qs Carthage, at which Au-
gustino was present, the place of president was filled by Aurelius,
archbishop of that city, and not by the legates of the Roman
see, though the express object of their attendauce was to support
the authority of the Roman pontifi. And, moreover, there was
a general council held in Italy, at which the bishop of Rome was
not present. This was the Oouncil of Aquileia, at which Arn-
brose presided, who was theu iu high credit with the emperor.
'l'here was no mention made of the bishop of Rome. We see,
therefore, that the dignity of Ambrose caused the see of Milan at
that time to have the precedeuce above that of Rome.

111. With respect to the title of primacy, and other titles of
pride, of which the pope now strangely boasts, it is not diffi-
cult to judge when aud in what manner they were introduced.
