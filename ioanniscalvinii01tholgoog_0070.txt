east 011 all obedience to (iod, and precipitata themselves into
the most unbridled licentiousncss; and some despise it, sup·
posing it to be subversive of all moderatim, order, and moral
distinctions. What can we do in this case, surrounded by such
difficulties? Shall we entirely discard Christian liberty, end so
preclude the occasion 01 such dangcrs? But, as we have ob·
served, unless this be understood, there can be 00 right know·
ledge of Christ, or of evangelical truth, or of internal peace 01
mind. We should rather exert ourselves to prevent the sup
pressiou of such a necessary branch of doctrine, and at the
same time to obviate those absurd objections which are fre·
quently deduced from it.

11. Christian liberty, according to my judgment, consiste
01 three parts. The first part is, that the consciences 01 be·
lievers, when seeking an assurance 01 their justification before
God, should raise themselves above the law, and forget all the
righteousness of the law For since the law, as we have else-
where demonstrated, leaves no man righteous, either we must
be excluded from all hope of justification, or it is necessary for
us to be delivered from it, and that so completely as not to have
any dependence on works. For he who imagines, that in order
to obtain righteousness he must produce auy works, however
small, carr fix 00 limit or boundary, but renders himself a debtor
10 the whole law. Avoiding, therefore, all mention of the law,
and dismissing all thought 01 our own works, in reference to
justification, we must embrace the Divine mercy alone, end
turning our eyes from ourselves, fix thern solely 00 Christ.
For the question is, not how we ean be righteous, but how,
though unrighteous and unworthy, we can be considered as
righteous. And the conscience that desires to attein any cer·
tainty respecting this, must give no admission 1ο the law. Nor
will this authorize any one to conclude, that the law is 01
00 use to believers, whom it still continues 10 instruct and
exhort, and stimulate 10 duty, although it has no place in their·
consciences before the tribunal 01 God. For these two things,
being very different, require to be properly aud carefully dis·
tinguished by us. The whole life of Christians ought to be an
exercise of piety, since they are called to sanctification. (s) It
is the office of the law to remind thern of their duty, and there·
by to excite thern to the pursuit 01 holiness aud integrity. But
when their consciences arc solicitous how God may be propi·
tiated, what answer they shall make, and on what they shall
rest their confidence, 11 called to his tribuual, there must then
be no consideration of the requisitions of the law, but Christ
alone must be proposed for righteousness, who exceeds all the
perfeetion of the law.
