importance. Victor submitted to the reproof without any oppo-
sition. It was a liberty at that time commonly used by the holy
bishops to exercise the privilege of brethren towards the bishop
of Rome, by admonishing and reproving him whenever he
committed any fault. He, in like manner, when occasion re·
quired, admonished others of their duty, aud reproved them for
their faults. For Cyprian, when he exhorta Stephon, bisbop of
Rome, to admonish the bishops of Franco, argues not from any
superior authority, but from the common rights which priests
enjoy among each other. lf Stepheu had then possessed any
authority over Franco, would not Cyprian bave said, You
should chastise thern, because they are subject to you? But
he expresses himself in a very different marmor. “This fra·
ternal union,'’ says he, “by which we are connected together,
requires us to administer to each other mutual admonitiou.”
And we see with what severity of language, though otherwise
aman of a rnild disposition, be censuras even Stephen himself,

when he considered him assuming too much consequence. In ,

this respect, also, there is yet no appearance of the bishop of Rome
having been invested with any jurisdiction overthose who were
not of his province.

VIII. With respect to the calling of councils, it was the duty
of every metropolitan, at stated sessons, to summou aprovincial
synod. There the bishop of Rome had uo authority. Buta
universal council could only be called by the emperor. For if
any one of tlre bishops had attempted this, not only he would
not have been obcyed by those who were out of his province,
but such an attempt would have led to immediate confusion.
Therefore the emperor sent a summons to attend to all of them
alilre. Socrates, indeed, in his Ecclesiastical History, states
that Julius, bisbop of Rome,e1postulated with the Esstern
bishops, for not having invited him to the Council of Antioch3
whereas the canons had forbidden that any thing should bc
decreed without the knowledge of the bishop of Rome. But
who does not see that this is to be understood of those decmes
which bind the universal (brurchl Now, it is no wonderif
there was so much respect paid to the antiquity and eminence
of the city, and to the dignity of the see, as to determine that
no general decree respecting religion should be passed in the
absence of the bishop of Rome, unless he refused to be present.
But what is this towards dominion over the whole Church?
For we do not deny that the bishop of Rome wasone of the
principal, but we will not admit, what the Romanists now
contend, that he had the authority over all.

IX. There remains the fourth kind of ecclesiastical power,
which consists in appeals. Itis evident that he possessos
supreme authority, to whose tribunal appeals are made. Many
