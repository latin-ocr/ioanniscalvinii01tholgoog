V. Now, though the minds of men ought to be continually
occupied with the study of this subject, yet as if they expressly
intended to abolish all remembrance of the resurrection, they
have called death the andos all things, aud the destructiones
man. For Solomon certainly speaks according toa common
md received opinion, when he says, “A living dog is better
than a dead lion.”(a) And again: “ Who knows whether the
spirit of man goeth upward, and the spirit os the beast goeth
downward i ’² (ὁ) This brutish stupidity has iniected all ages
os the world, and even forced its way into the Church3 lor the
Sadducees had the audacity publicly to profess, that there is
no resurrection, and that aouls are mortal. But that none
might be excused by this gross ignorance, the very instinct of
nature has always set before the eyes of nubelievers au image
of the resurrection. For what is the sacred and inviolable cus·
tom os interring the dead, but apledge oi another life? Nor
can it be objected that this originated in error ; sor the ritas of
sepulture were always observed among the holy fathers3 aud
it pleased God that the same custom should be retained among
the Gentiles, that their torpor might be roused by the image os
the resurrection thereby set before them. Though this cere·
mony produced no good effecta upon thern, yet it will be rise-

refutation of unbelief, that all united iu professing a thing that
none of them believed. But Satan has not only stupefied men’s
minda, to maire them bury the mernory of the resurrection
together with the bodies oi the dead, but has endeavoured to
corrupt this point of doctrine by various fictione, with an ul·
timete view to its total subversion. Not to mention that he
began to oppose it in the days of Paul, not long aiter arose the
Millenarians, who limited the reign of Christ to a thousand
years. Their fiction is too puerile to require or deserve refu·
tation. Nor does the Revelation, which they quote in favour
ot‘ their error, afford them any support ς ior the term osa thou-
sand years, there mentioned, (c) refers not to the eternal bless-
edness of the Church, but to the various agitatione which
awaited the Churoh iu its militant state upon earth. But the
whole Scriptura proclaims that vthere will be no end of the
happiness of the elect, or the punishment os the reprobate.
Now, all those things which are invisible to our eyes, oriar
above the comprehension of our minda, must either be believed
on the authority of the eracles ot‘ God, or entirely rejected.
Those who assign the children os God a thousand years to en·

honour they cast on Christ aud his kingdom. F'or if they are
