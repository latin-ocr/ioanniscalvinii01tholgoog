we might call upon him with a steady saith 3 and the familiar
appellation 01 Father is not only adapted to produce confideuce‚

we arc remiuded by his government 01 the world, that it is not
in vain 101 us 10 approach to him who makes us the objects 01
his present and voluutary care. “He that cometh 10 God
(says the apostle) must believe that heis, and that he is a re·
warder of them that diligently seek him.’' (g) Christ asserts
both these 01 his Father, that we may have first a firm saith
in his existence, and then a certain persuasion that, since hc
deigns 10 extend his providence 10 ue, he will not neglect our
salvation. By these principles, Paul preparas us 101 praying in
right manner ; sor his exhortatioa, “ Let your requests be made
known unto God,” is thus prefaced: “ The Lord is at hand.

the Psalmist without reason exclaim, “According to thy name,

wherever God may be known, there must necessarily be a
manifestation 01 his perfectione 01 power, goodness, wisdom,

God is so nujustly robbed 01 his holiness on earth, 11 11 is not
