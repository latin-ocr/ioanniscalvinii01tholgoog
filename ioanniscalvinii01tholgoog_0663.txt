next thing was, that they had such altercations among them,
brethren with brethren; for they were so far from bearing an
injury, that they coveted each other’s property, and molested
and injured one another without any provocation. It was
against that rage for litigation, therefore, that he inveighed,and
not absolutely against all controversias. But he pronounees it
·to be altogether a vice or a weakness, that they did not suffer
the injury or loss of their property rather than to proceed to
contentione sor the preservation of it: when they were so dis·
turbed or exasperated at every loss or injury, that they had
reconrse to lawsuits on the most trivial occasions, he argues that
this proved their minds to he too irritable, and not sufficiently
patient. lt is certainly incumbent on Christians, in all cases,
to preseraconcession os their right to an entrance on a lawsuit;
from which they can scarcely corne out without a mind exas-
perated and infiamed with enmity to their brother. But when
one sees that, without any breach of charity, he may defend
his property, the loss os which would be a serious injury to
him3 if he do it, he commits no offence against that sentence
os Paul. In a word, as we have observed at the beginning,
charity will give every one the best counsel; for, whatever
litigatione are undertaken without charity, or are carried to a
degree inconsistent with it, we conclude thern, beyond all con·
troversy, to be unjust and wicked.

XXII. The first duty os subjects towards their magistrates
is to entertain the most honourable sentiments of their function,
which they know to be a jurisdiction delegated to them from
God, and on that account to esteem and reverence them as
God’s ministers and vicegerents. For there are some persons
to be found, who show themselves very obedient to their
magistrates, and have not the least wish that there were no
magistrates for them to obey, because they know them to be
so necessary to the public good; but who, nevertheless, con-
sider the magistrates themselves as no other than necessary evils.
But something more than this is required of us by Peter, when
he commands us to “honour the king, ’' (i) and by Solomon,
when he says, “ Fear thou the Lord and the king, '² (lc) sor
Peter, under the term honour, comprehends a sincere and candid
esteem; and Solomon, by connecting the king with the Lord,
attributes to him a kind of sacred veneration and dignity. lt
is also a remarkable commendation of magistrates which is
given by Paul, when he says, that we “must needs be sub-
ject, not only lor wrath, but also sor conscience sake ; ” (l) by
which he means, that subjects ought to be induccd to submit to
princes and governors, not merely srom a dread of their power,
