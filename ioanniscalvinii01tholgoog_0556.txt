symbol, under which “that spiritual drink” was received,
though notin a manner discernible by the corporeal eye, so ,
bread is now called the body of Christ, because it is the sym-
bol under which the Lord truly offers us his body to eat. And
that no one may despise this as a novel sentiment, we shall
show that the same was entertained by Augustine. He says,
“ lf the sacraments had not some similitude to those things of
which they are sacraments, they would be no sacraments at all.
On account of this similitude, they frequently take the names
even of the things which they represent. Therefore, 'as the
sacrament of the body of Christ is in some sense that body it·
self, and the sacrament of the blood of Christ, is that blood it-
sels, so the sacrament of faith is called faith.” His works contain
many similar passages, which it would be useless to collect, as
this one is sufficient; only the reader ought to be apprized that
this holy father repeats and confirms the same observation in
an epistle to Euodius. It is a frivolous subterfuge to plead, that
when Augustine speaks of metonymical expressions, as fre·
quently and commonly used respecting the sacrarnents‚ he
makes no mention of the Lord's supper; for, if this were ad·
mitted, we could no longer reason from the genus to the species,
or from the whole to a part; it would not be a good argument
to say, that every animal is endued with the power of motion,
therefore oxen and horses are endued with the power of motion.
All further dispute on this point, however, is precluded by the
language of the same writer on another occasion - “ that Christ
did not hesitate to call it his body, when he gave it as the sign
of his body.” Again: “ It was wonderful patience in Christ,
to admit J udas to the feast, in which he instituted and gave to
his disciples the emblem of his body and of his blood.’'

XXII. But if some obstinate man, shutting his eyes against
every other consideration, should insist on this single expression,
“ This is my body,’' as though it made a distinction between
the suppor and all other sacraments, the answer is easy. They
allege that the verb substantive is too emphatical to admit of
any figure. If we grant this, the verb substantive is also used
by Paul, where he says, “ The breed which we break, is it not
the cornrnunion of the body of Christ i ’³ (r) But the commu-
nion of the body is something different from the body itself.
In almost all cases of sacraments, wc find the same word used -

“This is my covenant.’' “It is the Lord's passover.'’(s)
And to mention no more, when Paul says, “That Rock was
Christ,'’ (t) why do they consider the verb substantive less
emphatical in that passage than in the speech of Christ? Let
them also explain the force of the verb substantive in that place
