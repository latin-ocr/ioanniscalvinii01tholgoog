Vll. Nor is there any force in their reasoning, when they
contend that the sacramenta are not testimonias of the grace of
God, because they are often administered to the wicked, who
yet do not, in consequence of this, experience God to be more
propitious to them, but rather procura to themselves more

it is heard by many who despise it, nor even Christ himself,
who was soen and known by multitudes‚ of whom very few
received him. A similar observation may be applied to royal
edicts3 for great numbers os people despise and deride that soal
of authentication, notwithstanding they know that it prooeeded
frorn the monarch to confirm his will; some utterly disregard
it, as a thing not relating to them; others aven hold it in
execration; so that a survey of the correspondence of tha two
cases ought to produce greater approbation of the similitude
which l have before used. Therefore it is certain that the
Lord offers us his mercy, and a pledge os his grace, both in
his holy word and in the sacraments; but it is not apprehended
except by those who receive the word and sacramenta with a
certain faith3 as the Fathcr has offered and presented Christ to
all for salvadeu, bnt he is not known and received by all.
Angustine, intending to express this sentiment, somewhere says,
that the efficacy of the word is displayed in the sacrament,
“not because it is spoken, but because it is believed.'' There-
fore Paul, when he is addressing believers, speaks of the sacra·
ments so asto include in them tho communiones Christ; as
when he says, “As many of you as have been baptized into
Christ, have put on Christ.''(i) Again: “By one Spirit arc
we all baptized into ona body.” (lc) But when he speaks of
the improper nse of the sacraments, he attributes no more to
thern than to vain and useless figures; by which he signifies
that, however impleus persons and hypocrites, by their perver-
sion of the sacramenta, may destroy or obscure the effect of
Divine grace in them, yet that, notwithstanding this, whenever
and wherever God pleases, they afford a true testimony of the
communion os Christ, and the Spirit of God himself exhibits
and performs the very thing which they promise. We con·
clude, therefore, that sacramenta are truly called testimonies of
the grace of God, and are, as it were, seals of the benevolence
ba bears to us, which, by confirming it to our minds, sustain,
cherish, strengthen, aud increase our seith. The reasons which
