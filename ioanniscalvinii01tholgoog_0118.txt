Which indeed we acknowledge to be strictly true; but we
thence conclude, that they rob Christ of every thing, who con·
sider his intercession as unavailing without the assistance os
George and Hippolytus, aud other such phantasms.

XXVIII. But though prayer is properly restricted to wishes
and petitions, yet there is so great an affinity between petition
and thanksgiving, that they may be justly comprehended
under the same nosne. For the species which Paul enume-
rates, sall under the first member 0I this division. ln requests
aud petitions wc pour out our desires before God, imploring
those thIngs which tend to the propagatiou of his glory and the
illustration of his name, as well as those benefits which conduce
to our advantage. ln thanlrsgiviug we celebrate his benefi-
cence towards us with due praises, acknowledging all the bless-
Ings we have received as the gists os his liberality. Theresore
David has connected these two parts together: “ Call upon me
in the day 0I trouble: l will deliver thee, and thou shalt glorify
me.’' (c) The Scripture, not without reason, enjoins us the
continual use of both3 sor we have elsewhere said that our
want Is so great, and experience itself proclaims that we are
molested and oppressed on every side with such numerous and
great perplexities, that we all have sufficient cause for unceas-
ing sighs, and gruans, and ardent supplications to God. For
though they enjoy a freedom from adversity, yet the guilt of
their· slus, and the innumerable assaults of temptation, ought to
stimulate even the most eminent saints to pray lor relies. But
os the sacrifice of praise and thanlrsgiving there can be no inter·
ruption, without guilt; since God ceases not to accumulate on
us his vari0us benefits, according to our respectIve casea, in order
to coustraiu us, inactiva and sluggish as we arc, to the exercisc
os gratitnde. Finally, we are almost overwhelmed with such
great and copious effusions of his beneficencc 3 we are surrouuded,
whithersocver we turn our cyeS, by such numerous and amazing
miracles of his hand, that we never want matter os praise and
thanlrsgiving. And to be a little more explicit on this poInt,
since all our hopes and all our help are in God, (which has
already been sufficiently proved) so that we cannot enjoy
prosperity, either in our persons or in any of our affairs, without
his benedictiou‚ —it becomes us assiduously to commend to him
ourselves and all our concerns. Further, whatever we think,
speak, or act, let all our thoughts, words, and actions be under
his direction‚ subject to his will, and finally in hope os his as-
sistance. For the curse os God is denounced on all, who
deliberate and decide on any enterprise iu a reliance on them-
selves or ou any other, who engage iu or attempt to begin any
