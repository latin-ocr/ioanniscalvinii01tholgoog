who could endnre such gross absurdities? But these men act
in a manner still more absurd, who wish to be accounted and
called legitimate pastore of the Ghurch, and yet are not willing
to be so in reality. For how few of them are there, who
execute the government of their Churches even in appearance!
Many of them all their lifetime devour the reveuues of Churches,
which they never approach even to look at them. Others
cither go themselves, or send an agent once every year, that
nothing may be lost by farming thern out. When this abuse
first intruded itsel'f, they who wished to enjoy this kind of va·
cation from duty, exempted themselves by special privileges.
Now, it is a rare case for any one to reside in his own Church;
for they consider their Churches as no other than farms, over
which they place their vicars, as bailiffs or stewards. But it is
repugnant to common sense, thata man should be pmtor of a
flock, who naver saw one of the sheep.

Xll. It appears that some seeds of this evil had sprung up
in the time of Gregory, and that the rectorsof Churches began
to be negligent in preaching and teaching; for he heavily
complains of it in the following passages: ‘⁴ 'Phe world is full
of priests, but yet there are few labourers found in the har·
vest; because we undertake the sacerdotal office, bnt perform
not the work of the office.’' Again: “Because they have no
bowels of charity, they wish to be considered as lords; they
do not acknowledge themselves to be fathers. 'l'hey change
the place of humility into an aggrandizement of dominion.”
Again: “ But, Ο ye pastore, what are we doing, who receive
the wages and are not labourers? We have fallen into extra·
neous employments3 we undertake one thing, and perform
another. We relinquish the office of preaching3 and it isour
misfortune‚ 1 conceive, that we are called bishops, since wc
hold a title of honour, but not of virtue.’' Since ha uses such
severity of langnage against those who were only chargeable
with a want of sufficient assiduity, or diligence, in their office,
what would ha have said, if he had seen scarcely any, or very
few of the bishops, and among the rest hardly one ina hun-
dred, ascend a pulpit once in their lives? For things are
come to sucha pitch of frenzy, that it is generally esteemed
beneath the dignity of abishop to deliver a sarmento a con-
gregation. In the tirne of Bernard there had been some dc·
elension; but we sea how sharply he reproves and inveighs
against the whole body of the clergy, who, it is probable,
however, were far less corrupt in that age than they are in the
prffilii‘. Now, if any one will closelyobserveandstrictlyexamine
this whole form of ecclesiastical government, which exists at
the present day under the Papacy, he will find it a nest of
