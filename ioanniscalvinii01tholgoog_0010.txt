Fon the further elucidation of this subject, let us examine
what kind of righteousness can be found in men during the
whole course of their lives. Let ns divide thern into four
classes. For either they are destitute of the knowledge of
God, and immerged in idolatry3 or, having been initiated by
the sacramente, they lead impure lives, denying God in their
actions, while they confess him with their lips, and belong to
Christ only in name; orffthey are hypocriteS, concealing the
iniquity os their hearts with vain disguises; or, being regene-

’ rated by the Spirit os God, they devote themselves to true holi-
, ness. ln the first of these classes, judged of according to their

natural characters, from the crown os the head to the sole of
the soot there will not be found a single spark os goodness3
unless we mean to charge the Scriptnre with falsehood ln
these representations which it gives of all the sons of Adam -
that “the heart is deceitsul above all things, and desperately
wicked ; ’' (ro) that “every irnagination os man’s heart is evil
from his youth; ’⁴ (a) that “the thoughts ol man are vanity;
that there is no sear of God before his eyes; ” (y) that “ there
is none that understandeth‚ none that seelieth aster God3 '³ (z)
in a word, “that he is flesh‚’⁷(a)a term expressive of all
those works which are enumerated by Paul - “ adultery, sorni-

(rol Jer. xvii. 9. (a) Gen. vib ; viii. 21. (y) Palm xciv.ll; xxxvi. 1.
