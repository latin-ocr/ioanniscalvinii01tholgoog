against thee.” (v) 1 consess, indeed, that the operation of such
incentives would be fatal, were it not 101 the Divina aid,· but
our most benevolent Father, in his incomparable mercy, 1100
afforded a timely remedy, that allaying all perturbation, allevi-
ating all cares, and di'spelling all fears, he might gently allure
us to himself, and facilitate our approach to him, by the removal
01 every obstacle and every doubt.

Χ111. Audin the first place, when he enjoins us to pray,
the commandment itself implies 0 charge 01 impious contu·
macy, 11 we disobey it. No command can be more precise
than that in the psalm: “Call upon me 111 110 day of trou-
ble.” (to) But as the Scriptura recommends no one of the
duties of piety more frequently, it is unnecessary 10 dwell
any longer upon it. “ Ask, (says our Lord,) and it shall be
given you, lrnock, and it shall be opened unto you.'’ (a) Το
1113 precept, however, there is also annexed 0 promise, which ia
very necessary ; for though all men acknowledge obedience to
be due to a precept, yet the greater part 01 them would neglect
the calls of God, if he did not promise to be propitious to them,
and even 10 advauce to meet them. These two positione being

obedience and rebellion, but also convicted of unbelief ; because
they distrust the promises ; which is the more worthy 01 ob-
servation, since hypocrites, under the preterit 01 humility and
modesty, treat the command of God with such haughty con·
ternpt as to give no credit to his kind invitation, and even
defraud him ofa principal part of his worship. For after
having refused sacrifices, in which all holiness then appeared
10 00110101, he declares the principal and most acceptable part
of his service to be, “calling upon him in the day of trouble.'‘
Wherefore, when he requires what is due 10 him, and animatas
us to acheerful obedience, there are no pretexts for diffidence 01
hesitation sufficiently specious to excuse us. 'Phe numerous
texts 01 scripture, therefore, which enjoin us to call upon God,

confidence. lt were temerity to rush into the presence 01 God,
without 0 previous invitation from him. He therefore opens 0
way for us by his own word: ‘⁴1 will say, It is my people3
and they shall say, 'Phe Lord is my God.” (y) We see how
he leads his worshippers, and desires them to follow him ; and
therefore that there is no reason 10 1001 1001 the melody, which
he dictatas, should not be agreeable to him. Let us particu-
larly remember this remarkable character 01 God, by a reliance
011 which we shall easily surmount every obstacle: “O thou
