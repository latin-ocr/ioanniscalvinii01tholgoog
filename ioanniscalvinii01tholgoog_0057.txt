we mean, not merely what is taught by the schoolmen, “that
worlrs receive their value from the grace which accepts them ; ”
sor they suppose, that worlrs, otherwise inadequate to the at-
tainment os salvation by the legal covenant, are rendered sus-
ficient for this by the Divine acceptance oi them. But l assert,
that they are so defiled, both by other transgressione and by
their own blemishes, that they are of no value at all, except as
the Lord pardons both3 and this is no other than bestowing
on a man gratuitous righteousness. lt is irrelevant to this
subject, to allege those prayers oi the apostle, iu which he
desires such perfectiori sor believers, that they may be un·
blamable and irreprovable in the day of Christ. (e) 'l'hese
passages, indeed, the Celestines formerly perverted, in order to
prove aperfection οι righteousness in tha present lise. We
think it sufficient briefly ιο reply, with Augustino, “that all
the pious ought, indeed, to aspira to this object, to appear one
day immaculate and guiltlcss before the presence os God3 but
since the highest excellency in this life is nothing more than
a progress towards perfectiori, we shall never attain it, till,
being divested at once os mortality and sin, we shall sully
adhere to the Lord.’' Nevertheless,l shall not pertinaciously
contend with any person who chooscs to attribute to the saints
the character of perfection, provided he also defines it in the
words of Augustino himself ; who says, “When we denomi-
nate the virtue of the saints perfect, to this perfectiora itself
belongs the aclrnowledgment of imperfectior, both in truth
and in humility.'’
