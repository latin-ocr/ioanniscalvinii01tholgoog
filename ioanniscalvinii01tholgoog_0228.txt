with the Church. He has appointed pastors and teachers, that
his people might be taught by their lips ; 110 has invested them
with authority3 in short, 110 has omitted nothing that could
contributa to a holy unity of faith, and to the establishment of
good order. (0) First of all, he 1100 instituted Sacramenta,
which we know by experience 10 be means 01 1110 greatest
utiiity for the nourishmeut and support of 0111101111. Foras,
during our confinemeut in the prison of our flesh, we have not
yet attained 10 the 01010 01 angels, God 1100111 1110 wonderful
providence, accommodated himself to our capacity, by pre·
scribing 0 way in which we might approach him, notwithstand-

in whose bosom it 10 God’s will that 011 1110 children should be

by her maternal care, till they 0110111 0 10011110 age, arrd at length
reach the end 01 their 101111. For it is not lawful to “ put asun-

because itis 011011 impossible to discover any difference between
the children 01 001 and the ungodly3 between his peculiar
