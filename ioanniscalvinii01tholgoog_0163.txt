merit. lf you inquire the cause, the apostle assigns the fol·
lowing: “For he saith to Moses, 1 will have mercy on whom
1 will have meroy, and 1 will have compassion on whom 1
will have compassion.'' (q) And what is this but a plain de·
claration of the Lord, that he finds no carrse in men to induce
him to show favour to them, but derives it solely from his
own mercy; and therefore that the salvation of his people is
his worlr? When God fixos your salvation in himself alone,
why will· you descend into yourselfi When he assigns you
his mere mercy, why will you have recourse to your own
merite? When he confines all your attention to his mercy,
why will you divort part of it to the contemplation of your
own works? We must therefore come to that more select
people, whom Paul in another place tells us “God fore·
lrnew,’' (r) not using this word, according to the fancy of our
opponente, to signifya prospect, from a place of idle observa·
tion, of things which he hae no part in transacting, but in the
sense in which itis frequently used. For certainly, when
Peter says that Christ was “ delivered '’ to death “by the do-
terminate counsel and foreknowledge of God,” (s) he introduces
God not as a mere spectator, but as the Author of our salvation.
So the same apostle, by calling believers, to whom he writes,
“elect according to the foreknowledge of God,”(t) properly
expresses that secret predestination by which God has marked
out whom he would as his children. And the word purpose,
which is added as a synonymous term, and in common speech
is always expressive of fixed determination, undoubtedly im·
plies that God, as the Author of our salvation, does not go out
of himself. Iu this sense Christ is called, in the earne chapter,
the “Lamb foreknown before the foundation of tho world.”
For what can be more absurd or uninteresting, than God’s
loohiug from on high to see from what quarter salvation
would come to mankind? 'I'he people, therefore, whom Paul
describes as “ foreknown,” (u) are no other than a small num·
ber scattered among the multitude, who falsely pretend to be
the people of God. ln another place also, to repress the boast-
ing of lrypocrites assuming before the world the preeminence
among the godly, Paul declares, “The Lord knoweth them
that are his.” (a) Lastly, by this expression Paul designates
two classes of people, one consisting of the whole racc of
Abraham, the other separated from it, reserved under the eyes
of God, and concealed from the view of men. And this, with·
out doubt, he gathered from Moses, who aeserts that God will
be merciful to whom he will be mercifu13 though he is speak-
