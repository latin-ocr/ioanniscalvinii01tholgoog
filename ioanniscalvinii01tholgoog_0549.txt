rods: ” he would not call thern serpente, lest he might appear
to imply a transmutation which did not exist3 for those im-
postors had done nothing but dazzle the eyes of the spectatore.
What resemblance has this to the following and other similar
expressions: “The bread which we break;’' (b) “As often
as ye eat this bread; ” (c) “They continued in breaking of
bread?'’ (d) Itis certain that their eyes were only deceived
by the incantations of the magicians. There is greater uncer-
tainty with respect to Moses, by whose hand it was no more
difficult for God ιο make a rod into a serpent, and afterwards
ιο make the serpent into a rod again, than to invest angela
with material bodies, and soon after to disembody them again.
If the nature of this sacrament were the same, or bore any
affinity to the case we have mentioned, our opponents would
have some colour for their solution. We must, therefore, con·
sider it as a fixed principle, that the flesh of Christ is not truly
promised to us for food in the sacred supper, unless the true
substance of the external symbol corresponds to it. And as
one error gives birth to another,a passage of Jeremiah isso
stupidly perverted, in order to prove transubstantiation, that 1
am ashamed to recite it. The prophet complains that wood
was put into his bread ; (e) signifying that his enemies by their
cruelty had taken away all the relish of his food; as David in
a similar figure utters the following complaint: “They gave
me also gall for my meat, and in my thirst they gave me vine·
gar to drink.''(s) These disputante explain it as an allegory,
that the body of Christ was affixed to the wood of the cross3
and this, they say, was the opinion of some of the fathers.
lreply, we ought rather to pardon their ignorance, and bury
their disgrace in oblivion, than ιο add the effrontery of con·
straining them continually ιο combat the genuine meaning of
the ro het.

Xlel) Others, who perceive it to be impossible to destroy
the analogy of the sign and the thing signified, without sub-
verting the truth of the mystery, acknowledge that the bread
in the sacred supper is the true substance of that earthly and
corniptible element, and undergoes no change in itself; but
they maintain that it has the body of Christ included under it.
If they explained their meaning to be, that when the bread is
presented in the sacrament, it is attended with an exhibition
of the body of Christ, because the truth represented is insepa-
rable from its sign, I should make little objection; butas, by
placing the body itself in the bread, they attribute ubiquity to '
it, which is incompatible with its nature, and by stating it to
