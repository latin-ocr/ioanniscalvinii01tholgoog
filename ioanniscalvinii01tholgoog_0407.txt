bishops who have lived since the time of the apostles, sor having
usurped to themselves, under afalse pretext, the honour and
dignity which belonged to the magistrate.

V. But, on the other hand, it is also worth while to examine
what was the true and ancient nse of the jurisdiction os the
Church, and what a great abusa os it has been introduced;
that we may know what ought to be abrogated, and what
ought to be restored from antiquity, is we would overtum the
reign os Antichrist, and reiistablish the true kingdom of Christ.
In the first place, the object to be secured is the prevention of
offences, or the abolition os any that may have arisen. In the
use of it, two things require to be considered; first, that this
spiritual power be entirely separated from the power of the
sword; secondly‚ that it be administered, not at the pleastue
of one man, but by a legitimate assembly. Both these things
were observed in the purer ages of the Chmch. For the holy
bishops never exercised their authority by fines, imprisonments,
or other civil punishments; but, as became them, employed
nothing but the word os the iord, For the severest vengeance,
the ultimate punishment of the Choreb, is excommunication,
which is never resorted to without absolute necessity. Now,
excommunication requires no external force, but is content with
the power os the word of God. In short, the jurisdiction of the
primitive Church was no other than a practieal exposition of the
description which Paul gives of the spiritual authority os pastore.
This power he represents as conferred for the purpose os “casting
down imaginatione, and every high thing that exalteth itself
against the knowledge os God, and bringing into captivity every
thought to the obedience of Christ 3 and having in readiness to
revenge all disobedience.'' (a) As this is accomplished by the
preaching os the doctrine of Christ, so to preserve that doctrine
from falling into contempt, they who profess themselves os the
honsehold of saith ought to be judged by what that doctrine
contains. That cannot be done, except the ministry be accom-
panied with the power to take cognizance of those who are to
be privately admonished, or more severely censured, and also to
exclude from the communion of the Supper those who cannot
be admitted without a profanation of such a solemn sacrament.
Wheresore when he denies, in another place, that we have any

right “ to judge them that are without,'‘ (o) he makes the chil-
dren ol the church subject to the censures by which their saults
arc chastised, and implies tho existence at that time os judicatores
from which none of the believers were exempt.

Α vl, This power, as we have stated, was not in the hands os
one man, for him to act according to his own pleasure, but
