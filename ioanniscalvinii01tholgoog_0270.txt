are none in our day, or they are less conspicuous. By “evan-
gelista'’ 1 understand those who were inferior to the apostles
in dignity, but next to them in office, and who performed sim·
ilar functions. Such were Lake, Timothy, Titus, and others
of that description3 and perhaps also the seventy disciples,
whom Christ ordained to occupy the second station from the
apostles. (lc) According to this interpretation, which appears
to me perfectly consistent with the language and meaning of
the apostle, those three offices were not instituted to be of
perpetual continuance in the Ohnrch, but only for that age
when Ohurches ware to be raised where none had existed be·
fore, or were at least to be conducted from Moses to Christ.
Thoughl do not deny, that, even since that period, God has
sometimes raised up apostles or evangelists in their stead‚ es
he has done in our own time. For there was a necessity for
such persons to recover the Chareh from the defection of Aa·
tichrist. Nevertheless, 1 call this an extraordinary office,
because it has no placeio well-constituted Churches. Next
follow “ pastors '' and “ teachers,’' who are always indispensable
to the Ohurch. The difference between them l apprehend to
be this-that teachers have no official concern with the disci·
pline, or the administratioa of the sacraments, or with admoni-
tions and exhortations, but only with tlre interpretation of the
Scripture, that pure and sound doctrine may be retained among
believers; whereas the pastoral office includes all these things.

V. We have now ascertained what offices were appointed to
continue fora time in the government of the Church‚ and what
were instituted to be of perpetual duration. If we connect
the evangelists with the apostles, as sustaining the same office,
we shall then have two offices of each description, correspond-
ing to each other. For our pastors bear the same resemblance
to the apostles, as our teachers do to the ancient prophete.
The office of the propheta was more excellent, on account of
the special gift of revelation, by which they were distinguished3
but the office of teachers is executed m a similar manner, and
has precisely the same end. So those twelve individuals‚
whom the Lord chose to promulgate the first proclamationes
his gospel to the world, preceded all others in order and dignity.
For although, according to the meaning and etymology of the

word, all the ministers of the Ohurch may be called apostles,
became they are all sent by the Lord, and are his messengers,
yet, as it was of great importauce to have a certain knowledge
of the mission of persons who were to announcc a thing new
and unheard before, it was necessary that those twelve, together
with Paul, who was afterwards added to their number, should
be disnnguishod beyond all etlam by a peculias title Paul
