For indeed he imitates him, who, despising the society of an·
gels, endeavoured to usurp supreme power to himself.” In
another place, writing to Eulogius, bishop of Alexandria, and
Anastasius, bishop of Antioch, he says, “Nune of my prede·
cessors would ever use this profane word. For if one patriarch
be called universal, the name of patriarch is taken away from
ell the rest. But far be it from any Christian heart to wish to
arrogate to himself any thing that would in the least degree
diminish the honour of his brethren. To consent to that exe·
crable term is uo other than to destroy the saith. Our obliga·
tion to preserve the unity os the saith is one thing, and to
repress the haughtiness of pride is another. But 1 conlidently
essert, that whoever calls himself traicerent bishop, or desires
to be so called, in such aggrandizement is the precursor of Au·
tichrist, because he prondly sets up himself above all others.”
Agaiu, to Anastasius, bishop of Antioch: “l have said that
the bishop of Constantinople can have no peace with us, unless
he would correct the haughtiness of that superstitious and
prend title which hasbeen invented by the first apostate; and
to say nothing of the injury done to your diguity, if one bishop
be called universal, when he falls, the whole Ohurch siuks at
once.’' But his assertion that this honour was offered to [eo
in the Council of Chalcedon has not the least appearance of
truth. For there is not a word of this iu the acts of that
council. And Leo himself, who iu many of his epistles cen·
sures the decree passed there in favour of the see of Constanti·
nople, would certainly not have passed over this argument,
which would have been the most plausible of all, if that honour
had really been offered to him,and he had refused it; and,
having otherwise an immoderate thirst for honour, he would
not readily have omitted a circumstance so much to his praise.
Gregory was mistaken, therefore, in supposing that title to
have been given to the see os Rome by the Council of Chalce-
don. I forbear to remark how ridiculous it is for him to
essert that the hnly council conferred such a title, which he at
the same time declares was profane, execrable, abominable,
prend, and sacrilegions, and even invented by the devil, and
published by the herald of Antichrist. And yet he adds that
his predecessor refused it, lest, by the dignity given to oue
individual, all other bishops should be deprived of the honour
due to them. ln another place he says, “No one has ever
wished to be called by such a name; no one has arrogated to
himself this presumptuous title; lest, by assuming to himself
the exclusive dignity of supreme bishop, he might seem to
deny the episcopal honour to all his brethren.”
