810 one breed and one body; for we are all partakcrs of that
one bread.” (l) We have derived considerable benefit from
the sacrament, if this thought be impressed aud engraveu upon
our minds, that it is impossible for us to wound, despise, re-
ject, injure, or in any way to offend one of our brethren, but
we, at the same time, wound, despise‚ reject, injure, and offend
Christ in him3 that we have no discord with our brethren
without being, at the same time, at variance with Christ 3 that
we cannot love Christ without loving him in our brethren;
that such care as we talre of our own body, we ought to ex·
ercisc the same care of our brethren, who are members of our
body; that as no part of our body can be in any pain without
every other part feeling correspondent sensatione, so we ought
not to suffer our brother to be afflicted with any calamity with·
out our sympathizing in the same. Wherefore, it is not with·
out reason that Augustino so frequently calls this sacrament
“the bond of charity.’' For what more powerful stimulus
could be employed to excite mutual charity among us, than
when Christ, giving himself to us, not only invites us by his
example mutually to devote ourselves to the promotion of one
another’s welfare, but also, b⁰y making himself common to all,
makes us 811 to be one with himself?

XXXIX. This fumishes the best confirmation of whatl
have stated before, that there is no true administration 01 the
sacrament without the word. For whatever advantage accrues
to us from the sacred supper requires the word; whether we
are to be confirmed in faith, exercised iu confession, or excited
to duty, there is need of preaching. Nothing more prepos-
terous, therefore, can be done with respect to the supper, then
to convert it into a mute action, as we have seen done under
the tyranny of the pope. For they have maintained that all
the validity 01 the consecration depends on the intention of
the priests, as if it had nothing to do with the people, to whom -
the mystery ought priucipally to be explained. They fell into
this error, 101 want of observing that those promises on which
the consecration rests, are not directed to the elements them·
solves, but to the persons who receive them. Christ does not
address the breed, to command it to become his body; but
enjoins his disciples to eat, and promises them the communica·
tion of his body and blood. Nor does Paul teach any other
order than that the promises should be offered to believers,
together with the breed and the cup. And this is the truth.
We are not to imagine any magical incantation, or think it suffi-
cient to have muttered over the words, as if they were heard by
the elements3 but we are to understand those words, by which
