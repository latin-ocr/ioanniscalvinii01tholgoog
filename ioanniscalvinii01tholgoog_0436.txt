ened to every crime. Yet this prohibition clearly shows how
pestilent are all their traditions; since it has not only deprived
the Church of upright arrd able pastore, but has formedahorrible
guls of enormities, and precipitated many souls into the abyss
of despair. The interdiction of marriage to priests was certainly
an act of impious tyranuy, not only contrary to the vrord of God,
but at variance with every principle of justice. ln the first
place, it was on no account lawsul forman to prohibit that
which the Lord had lest free. Secondly, that God had ex·
pressly provided in his word that this liberty should not be in·
sringed, is too clear to require much prool. Isay nothing of the
direction, repeatedly given by Paul, that a bishop should be
“ the husband os one wife ;’' (d) but what could be expressed
with greater force, than where he announces a revelation
from the Holy Spirit, “ that in the latter times some shall depart
from the saith, forbidding'to marry,’' and represents these not
only as impostors, bnt as disseminating “doctrines of devils.'’ (e)
This, therefore, was a prophecy, a sacred oracle of the Holy
Spirit, by which he intended from the beginning to forearm
tlre Ohurch against dangers-that the prohibition of marriage is
a doctrine os devils. But our adversaries imagine themselves to
bave admirably evaded this charge, when they misapply it to
Montanus, the Tatianists‚ Encratites, and other ancient heretice.
lt refers, say they, to those who have condemned marriage
altogether3 we by no means condemn it 3 we merely prohibit
it to the clergy, from an opinion that it is not proper for thern.
As if, though this prophecy had once been accomplisbed in those
ancient heretics, it might not also be applicable to them3 or as
if this puerile cavil, that they do not prohibit marriage, because
they do not prohibit it to all, were deserving of the least attention.
This is just as if a tyrant should contend that there can be no
injustice in a law, the injustice os which only oppresses one
part ol a nation.

XXIV. They object, that there ought to be some mark to
distinguish the clergy from the laity. As though the Lord
did not foresee what are the true ornaments in which priests
ought to excel. By this plen, they charge the apostle with
disturbing the order and violating the decorum of the Ohuroh,
who, in delineating the perfect model of a good bishop, among
the other virtues which he required in him, dared to mention
marriage. I know that they interpret this to mean, that no
oue is chosen a bishop who shall have bada second wife.
Andr grant that this interpretation is not new3 but that it is
erroneous, is evident from the context itselt'3 because he imme-
diately after prescribes what characters the wives of bishops
and deacons ought to possess. Paul places marriage among
