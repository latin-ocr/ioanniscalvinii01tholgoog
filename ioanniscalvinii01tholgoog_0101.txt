word unto thy servant.” (lc) And all the Israelites together,
whenever they fortify themselves with a recollection of the co-
venant, sufficiently declare that fear ought to be banished from
our devotione, because it is contrary to the Divino injunction3
andin this respect they imitated the examples of the patriarche,
particularly of Jacob, who, after having confessed himself “not
worthy of the least of all the mercies'' he had received from
the hand of God, yet declares himself animated to pray for
still greater blessings, because God had promised to grant
them. (l) But whatever be the pretences of unbelievers, for
not applying to God under the pressure of every necessity, for
not secking him or imploring his aid, they are equally charge·
able with defrauding him os the honour due to him, as if they
had fabricated for themselves new gods and idols3 for by this
conduct, they deny him to be the Author of all their blessings.
On the contrary, there is nothing more efficacious to deliver be·
lievers from every scruple, than this consideration, that no im·
pediment ought to prevent their acting according to the com·
mand of God, who declares that nothing is more agreeablc to
him than obedience. These observations tend more fully to
elucidata what 1 have advanced beforc3 that a spirit of bold-
ness in prayer is perfectly consistent with sear, reverence, and
solicitude ; and that there is no absmdity in God's exalting those
who are abased. This establishes an excellent agreement be·
tween those apparently repugnant forms of expression. Both
Jeremiah and Daniel use this phrase: “ Malta prayers fall '' be·
fore God; for so it is in the original. (m) Jeremiah also: “let
our supplication fall before thee.'' (n) Again: believers are
frequently said to “ lift up their prayer.’' (o) So says Hezekiah,
when requesting the prophet to intercede for him. And David
desires that his prayer may ascend “as incense.'’ (p) For
though, under apersuasion of God’s fatherly love, they cheer·
fully commit themselves to his faithfulness, and hesitate not to
implore the assistance he sreely promises, yet they are not im·
pudently elated with careless security, but ascend upwards by
the steps of the promises, yet in such amanner, that they still
continue to be suppliant and sels-abased.

XV. Here several questions are started. The Scriptura re·
lates that the Lord has complied with some prayers, which
nevertheless did not arisc from a calm or well-regulated heart.
Jotham, for ajust cause indeed, but from the impulse of rage,
resentment, and revenge, devoted the inhabitants of Shechem to
the destmction which afterwards fell upon them : (q) the Lord,
by fulfilling this curse, seems to approve of such disorderly
