ceived ecclesiasticsl unctiori and tonsure. 'I'he ordinance οἱ
the eternal God is, “Drinlrye allos it;” which man has re-
pealed and abrogated by a new and contrary law, ordaining
that all shall not drinlr of it. And these legislators, that they
may not appear to resist their God without reason, plead the
dangers which might result if this sacred cup were indiscrimi-
nately presented to all; as though those dangers had not been
soreseen and considered by the eternal wisdom os God. ln the
next place, they argue with great subtlcty‚ that one is sufficient
ior both. For, is it be the body, they say, itis the whole of
Christ, who cannot now be separated from his body. The
body, therefore, contains the blood. See bow human reason
is at variance with God, when it has once been leit to its own
vagaries. Exhibiting the breed, our Lord says, “This is my
body;” exhibiting the cup, hc says, “This is my blood.”
The andacity os human reason contradicts this, and effirms
that the bread is the blood, aud that the wine is the body; as
is the Lord had distinguished his body from his blood, both by
words and by signs, without any cause, and as if it had ever
been heard that the body or blood of Christ was called God
and man. Certainly, if he had intended to designate his
whole person, he might heresuid, “ It isl,’' as the Scripture
tells us he did on other occasiorrs; and not, “This is my
body; this is my blood.” But, with a view to aid the wealr-
ness os our saith, he exhibits the bread and the cup separately,
to teach us that he is sufficient sor drinlr as well as ior t'ood.
Now, let one os these parts be taken away, and we shall find
only half os our nourishment iu him. Though it were true,
then, as they pretend, that the blood is in the breed, and the
body in the cup, yet they defraud the souls os believers of that
confirmation which Christ has delivered as necessary sor them.
Therefore, leaving their subtleties, let us hold inst the benefit
which arises from the double pledge which Christ has ordained.

XLVIII. 1 am aware os the cavils advanced on this subject
hythe ministers os Satan, who are accustomed to treat the
Scriptura with contempt. In the first place, they plead, that
a simple act affords no sufficient ground from which to deduce
a rule of perpetual obligation on the observance os the Charch.
But it is false to call it a simple act; for Christ not only gave
the cup to his apostles, but also commanded them to do the
same in time to corne. For it is the language os command,
“Drinlr ye all os it.” And Paul mentions its having been
practised in such a way as fully implies its being a positive or·
dinance. The second subterfuge is, that Christ admitted none
but the apostles to a participation os this supper, whom he had
already chosen and admitted into the order of sacrificing priests.
But l would wish them to give me answers to five questions,
