tered by the apostles, during his life on earth, was called
his; yet it was attended with no greater abundance of the
Spirit than the baptismos John. And even after his ascen-
sion‚ the Samaritano, even though they had been baptized
in the name of Jesus, received no other gifts of the Spirit
than those which were common to all believers, till Peter
and John w'ere sent to lay their hands upon them. (ι’) Ι
suppose that the fathers were misled into an opinion, that the
baptism of John was merely apreparatiou for that of Christ, (k)
entirely from an apprehension that some persons, who had
previously received the baptismos John, were baptized again
by Paul. But that they were mistalren in this point, shall be
very clearly shown in the proper place. What is the meaning,
then, of the declaration of John, that he ‘⁴ baptized with water,”

through the Red Sea, and drowned Pharaoh himself, and the
