say, with Augustino, that the Lord created these who, he cer·
tainly soreknew, would fall into destruction, and that this was
actually so because he willed it; but of his will it belongs not
to us to demand the reason, which wo are incapable os eom-
prehending; nor is it reasonable that the Divine will should
be made the subjectos controversy with us, which, whenaver
it is discussed, is only another name sor the highest rule os
justice. Why, then, is any question started concerning injus-
tice, where justice ia evidently conspicuous? Nor let us be
aehamed to follow the example os Paul, and stop the mouths
of unreasonable and wieked men in this manner, repeating the
sarne auswer as osten as they shall dare to repeat their com-
plaints. Who are you, miserable mortale, preferring an ac·
cusation against God, because he accommodares not the great·
neas os his works to your ignorance? as though they were
necessarily wrong, because they are concealed from carnal
view. Of the immensity os God's judgments you have the
clearest evidenees. You know they are called “a great deep.'’
Now, examine your contracted intellects, whether they can
comprehend God's secret dearces. What advantage or satis-
faction do you gain from plunging yourselves, by your mad
researches, into an abyss that reason itsels pronounces will be

sul ignorance is better thau presumptuons knowledge. Seek
merits; you will find nothing but punishment. Othe depth!
Peter denies; the thies believes3 Ο the depth! Do you seek a
reason? lwill trembleat the depth. Do you reason? lwill
wonder. Do you disputa? lwill believe. Isee the depth,

tion. He calls the jurlgments os God unsearchable; and are
you come to scrutinize them? He says, his ways are past
finding out; and are you corne to investigate them ? ’' We
shall do no good by proceeding any further3 it will not satisfy
their petuleum, and the Lord needs no other desence than
what he has employed by his Spirit, speaking by the mouth
of Paul 3 and we terget to speak well when we ceaae to speak
with God.

VL lmpiety produces also a second objection, which directly
tenda, not so much to the crimination os God, as to the vindi·
cationes the sinner; though the sinner whom God condemna
munet be justified without the diagrace os the Judge For
