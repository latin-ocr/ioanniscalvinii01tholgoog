trim the lamps, 10 sweep the Churches, to catch mica, and to
drive out dogs. Who could suffer such persons to be called
apostles, and 10 be compared with the apostles of Christ? Let
them uerter again salsely represent those as deacons, whom they
merely appoint to act a part iu their farcical exhibitions. 'I'he
very name which they bear sufficieutly declares the nature 01
their office, For they call them Levites, and wish to deduce their
origin srom the sons 01 Levi. This Ι have no objection to their
doing, provided they drop their pretensions to Christianity.
XXXlll. 01 what use is it 10 say any thing respecting sub-
deacons? lu ancient times they actually had the care 01 the
poor. 'l'he Romanists attribute to them 1 know not what
nugatory functions3 as 10 bring the chalice and patine, the
flagon with water, and the towel to the altar, to pour out water
101 washing the hands 01 the priests, and similar services.
When they spealr of the sub-deacons receiving and bringing
oblations, they mean those which they devour as consecrated
10 their use. With this office the ceremony 01 their initiation
perfectly corresponds: they receive 110111 the bishop the patine
aud chalice, 110111 the archdeacon the flegon with water, the
manual, and similar trumpery. They requirens 10 confess the
Holy Ghost to be contained in these fooleries. What pinus
person can bear to admit this? But to come 10 an end, we
may draw the same conclusion respecting them as respecting
the rest, nor is it necessary to repeat any more 01 what we
have already stated. This will be sufficient 101 persons of
modest and docile minds‚ to whom this book is addressed; ,
that there is no sacrament 01 God, which does not exhibit a
ceremony annexed to a promise, 01 rather which does not
present a promise in a ceremony. In this case not a syllable is
10 be found 01 any certain pronrise3 and, tlreresore,·it is iu
vain 10 00011 101 0 ceremony to confirm the promise. And 01
all the ceremonias which they use, not one appears 10 have been
instituted by θοᾶς therefore there can be no sacrament.

XXXIV. 'I'he last 01 their sacramente is matrimony‚ which
all consess 10 have been instituted by God, but which no one,
till the time 01 Gregory, ever discovered to have been en-
joined as asacrament. And what man, in his sober sensas,
would ever have talren it into his head? It is alleged to be a
good and holyordinanceos God; and so agriculture,architecture,
shoemalring, and many other things, are legitimate ordinauces
ns God, aud yet they are not sacraments. For it is required
in a sacrament, not only that it bea work 01 God, but that it
be au exterual ceremony appointed by God 101 the confirmation
