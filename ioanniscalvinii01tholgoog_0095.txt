the certain hopc of obtaining our requeats. lt isindeed an
apparent contradiction, to connect a certain confidence of God’s
favour with a sense of his righteons vengeance3 though these
two things are perfectly consistent, if persons oppressed by
their own guilt be encouraged solely by the Divina goodness.
Foras we have before stated, that repentance and saith, of
which one terrifica, and the other exhilaratas, are inseparably
connected, so their union is necessary in prayer. And this
agreement isbriefly expressed by David: “I will come (says
he) into thy house in the multitude os thy mercy; and in thy
fear willl worship toward thy holy temple.'' (ι’) Under the
“goodness os God,'’ he comprehends faith, though not to the
exclusion of fear; for his majesty not only commands our
reverence, but our own unworthiness makes us forget all
pride and security, and fills us with sear. Ido not mean a
confidence which delivers the mind from all sense of anxiety,
and soothes it into pleasant and perfect tranquillity3 for such a
placid satisfaction belongs to those whose prosperity is equal
to their wishes, who are affected by no care, corroded by no
desire, and alarmed by no sear. And the saints have an ex-
cellent stimulus to calling upon God‚ when their necessities and
perplexities harass and disquiet thern, and they are almost de-
spairing in themselves, till saith opportunely relieves them; be·
cause, amidst such troubles, the goodness of God isso glorious
in their view, that though they groan under the pressure of
present calamities, andare likewise tormented with the fear of
greater in future, yet a reliauce on it alleviares the difficulty of
bearing them, and encourages a hope of deliverance. 'Phe
prayers of a pious man, therefore, must proceed from both these
dispositione, and must also contain arrd discover them both;
though he must groan under present evils, and is anxiously
afraid οἰ new ones, yet at the same time he must resort for
refuge to God‚ not doubting his readiness to extend the as-
sistance os his hand. For God is highly incensed by our
distrust, if we supplicate him for blessings which we have no
expectation of receiving. There is nothing, therefore, more
suitable to the nature of prayers, than that they be consonned
to this rule—not to rush forward with temerity, but to follow
the steps of saith. Το this principle Christ calls the attention
of us all in the following passage: “l say unto yon, What
things soever ye desire, when ye pray, believe that ye receive
them, and ye shall have them.'’ (lc) This he confirma also in
another place: “ Whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
ye shall receive.''(l) With which James agrees: “If any of
you lack wisdom, let him ask of God‚ that giveth to all men
