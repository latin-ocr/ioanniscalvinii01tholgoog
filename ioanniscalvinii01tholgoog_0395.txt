worship, thet is, voluntary worship, invented by men, without
the word of God. (c) And so indeed it is, that our own wisdom,
eud that of all other men, must become folly in our esteem,
that we may allow God alone to bc truly wise. This is very
far from being the case with those who study to render them·
selves acceptable to him by petty observances of human coo·
trivance, and obtrude upon him, in opposition to his commende,
ahypocritical obedience‚ which in reality is rendered to men.
This was the conduct of men in former ages; the same has hap-
pened within our own remembrance,and still happens in those
places where the authority of the creature is more regarded than

‘ that os the Creator3 where religion, il religion it deserves to be

called, is polluted with more numerous and senseless supersti-
tious than ever disgraced the worship os paganism. For what
could proceed from the minds of men but things carnal, soolish,
and truly expressive of their authors?

XXV. When the advocates os superstition allege, thet
Samuel sacrificed in Rarnah, that there this was done without
the direction of the law, yet it was acceptable to God, (d) the
answer is easy-thet this was not the erectiori os a second
altar, in opposition to one already created, and appointed by the
Divine command to supersede every other3 but es there had yet
been no fixed place assigned for the ark os the covenaut, he ap-
pointed the town which he inhabited sor the oblation of sacrifices,
as the most convenient place. lt certainly was not the intention
of the holy prophet to make any innovation in religious worship,
in which God had so strictly forbidden any thing to be added or
diminished. The example of Manoah 1 consider as an extra-
ordinary and singular case. Though a private man, he offereda
sacrifice to God, yet not without the Divine approbation; be-
cause he did it not from the hasty impulse of his own mind, but
in consequence of the secret inspiration of Heaven. (e) But of
the Lord’s utter abomination of ell the contrivances of mortels in
his worship, we have a memoreble example in another person,
not inferior to Manoah -Imean Gideon, whose ephod produced
fatal consequences‚ not only to himself end his family, but to
all the people. (s) ln short, every additional invention by
which meu pretend to serve God is nothing but a pollutiou of
true holiness.

XXVI. Why, then, it is inquired, was it the will of Christ
that men should submit to those intolerable burdens which were
imposed upon thern by the scribes aud Pharisees? (g) 1 ask,
on the other hand, Why did Christ, in another place, direct men
to “beware of the leaven of the Pharisees aud of the Saddu-
