This is concisely and beautifully represented by Angustiae,
when he says, “1 do not say to tbe iord, Despise uot the
works of my hands l have sought the [οπο witb my hands,
and 1 have not been deceived. But 1 commend nottho works
of my hands3 for 1 fear that when thou best examined thern,
thou wilt find more sin than merit. 'l'bis only 1 say, this 1
aslr,tbis1desire; Despise not the works οι thy hands. lle·
hold in me thy work, not mine. Porif thou beboldest mine,
thou condemnent me, if thou beholdest thiae own, thou
crownest me. Βοοοιιιο whatever good works 1 hsve, they are
from thee.‘' He assigna two masona why he ventured not to
boastofhis workstoGod; first, thatifhebesany good ones,
he sees nothing of his own in them ; secondly, that even these
are buried under a multitude of sins. Hence the conscience
experiences more fear and consternation than security. There·
fore he desires God ιο behold his best performsnces, only that
he may recognize in them tbe grace of his own calling, and
perfect the work which he has began.

XXI. 'Phe remaining objection is, that the Scripture repre-
sents the good works of believers as the causes for which
the Lord blesses thern. But this must be understood so as not
to effect what we have before proved, that the efficient cause
of our salvationis the love of God the Father; the material
cause, the obedience of the Son3 the instrumentsl castse, the
illumination of the Spirit, that is, faith; and the final cause,
the glory of the infinite goodness of God No obstacle arises
from these things to prevent good works being considered by
the Lord as inferior causes. But bow does this happen? Be-
cause those whom his mercy bas destined to the inheritance of
eternal life, he, in his ordinary dispensatione, introduces to tbe
possession of it by good works. That which, in the order of his
dispensatione, precedes, he denominates the cause of that which
follows. For this reason he sometimes deduces eternsl life
from works; not that tbe acceptance of it is to be referred to
them; but became he justifies the objects of his election, that
he may finally glorify them; he makes the former favour,
which is a step to tbe succeeding one, in some sense the cause
cf it. But whenever the true cause is to be assigned, he does
not direct us to take refuge in worlrs, but contines our thoughts
entirely to his mercy. For what does he teach us by the
apostle? “ The weges of sin is death; but the gift of God is
eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.’' Why does he not
oppose righteousness to sin, as well as life to death? Why
does be not malta righteousness the cause of life, as well as sin
the cause os death? For then the antithesis would have been
complete, whereas by this variaticn it is partly destroyed. But
the apostle intended by this comparison to express a certain
