by the ancient writers, that whatever the Ohurch possessed,
whether in lands or in money, was the patrimony of the poor.
The bishops and deaeonS, therefore, are continually reminded
that they are not managing their own treasures, but those des-
tined to supply the necessity of the poor, which if they un·
faithfully withhold or embezzle, they will be guilty of murder.
Hence they are admonished to distribute this property to the
parties entitled to it, with the greatest cantion and reverence,
as in the sight of God, and without respect of persons. Hence
also the solemn protestations of chrysostom, Ambrose, Augus·
tine, and other bishops, assuring the people of their integrity.
Now, since it is perfectly equitablc, and sanctioned by the law
of the Lord, that those who are employed in the service of
the Church should be maintained at the public expense of the
Church,—and even in that age some presbytera-consecrated
their patrimonies to God, and reduced themselves to voluntary
poverty‚ —the distribution was such, that neither were the mi·
nisters left without support, nor were the poor neglected. Yet,
at the same time, care was taken that the ministers themselves,
who ought to set an example of frugality to others, should not
have enough to be abused to the purposes of splendour or deli·
cacy, but only what would suffice to supply their necessities.
“Fon” says Jerome, “those of the clergy who are able to
maintain themselves from their own patrimony, if they take
what belongs to the poor, are guilty of sacrilege, and by such
an abuse, they eat and drink judgment to themselves.’'

Vll. At first the administration was free and voluntary, the
bishops and deacons acting with spontaneous fidelity, and integ-
rity of conscience and innocense of life supplying the place of
laws. Afterwards, when the cupidity or corrupt dispositione
of some gave birth to evil exemplos, in order to correct these
abusae, canons were made, which divided the ravennas of the
Church into four parts, assigning the first to the clergy, the
second to the poor, the third to the reparation of Ohurches and
other buildings, the fourth to poor strangers. For, though
other canons assign this last part to the bishop, this forms no
variation from the division which 1 have mentioned. For the
intention was, that it should be appropriated to him, neither
for his own exclusive consumption, nor for lavish or arbitrary
distribution, but to enable him to support the ‚hospitality which
Paul requires of persons in that office. (f) And so it is ex·
plained by Gelasius and Gregory. For Gelasius adduces
no other reason why the bishop should claim any thing for
himself, than to enable him to communicate to captives and
strangers And Gregory is still more explicit. He says, “It
