And this ignorance is so much the less excusable, because they
appear almost professedly to disregard so many testimonias of
Scriptura. David experienced frequent deliverances by the
Divine power, was it that he might arrogate it to himself, in
order to deliver us by his interposition? He makes some very
different declaratione: “ The righteous shall compass me about 3
for thou shalt deal bountifully with me.” (a) Again: “They
looked unto him, and were lightened; and their faces were not
ashamed. This poor man cried, and the Lord heard him, and
saved him out of all his troubles.”(y) The Psalms contain
many such prayers‚ in which he implores God to grant his
requests from this consideration, that the righteous may not be
put to sharne, but may be encouraged by his example to enter-
tain a good hope. Let us be contented at present with one
instance: “For this shall every one that is godly pray unto
thee in a time when thou mayest be found ; ’' (z) a text which
1 have the more readily cited, because the hireling and cavil-
ling advocates of Popery have not been ashamed to plead it to
prove the intercession of tbe dead. As though David had any
otber design than to show the effect which would proceed from
the Divine clemency and goodness when his prayers should be
heard. And in general it must be maintained, that an ex·
periance of the grace of God, both to ourselves and to others,
affords no small assistance to confirm our faith in his promises.
l do not recite numerous passages, where he proposes to him·
self the past blessings of God as a ground of present and future
confidence, since they will naturally occur to those who peruse
the Psalms. Jacob by his example bad long before taught the
same lesson: “l am not worthy of the least of all the mercios,
and of all the truth, which thou hast showed unto thy servant ς
for with my staff l passed over this Jordan3 and now Ι am be·
come two bands.’' (a) He mentions the promise indeed, but not
alone; he likewise adds the effect, that he may in future con·
fide with the greater boldness in the continuance of the Divine
goodness towards him. For God is not like mortale, who grow
weary of their liberality, or whose wealth is exhausted3 bnt is
to be estimated by his own nature, as is judiciously done by
David, when he says, “Thou hast redeemed me, 0 Lord God
of truth.”(b) After ascribing to him the praise of his salva·
tion, he adds, that he is a God of truth ; because, unless he
were perpetually and uniformly consistent with himself, there
could not be derived from his benefits a sufficient argument for
confiding in him, and praying to him. But when we know
that every act of assistance, which he affords us, is a specimen
