must allow no infirmity iu the Church. The other passage, as
we have already seen, has a meaning totally different from
what they pretend. For after Paul had instructed Timothy in
the true nature of the office-of a bishop, he says, “These things
l write unto thee, that thou mayest know how thou oughtest
to behave thyself in the house of God; ’' and to enforce his
conscientious attention to this object, he adds, that the Church
itself is “ the pillar and gromrd os the truth.'' (w) Now, what
isthe meaning of this expression, but that the truth of God is
preserved in the Church, and that by the ministry of preaching?
Asin another place he states, that Christ “gave some apostles,
and some prophete, and some evangelists, and some pastore and
teachers, that we be no more carried about with every wind of
doctrine‚’' or deluded by men, but that, being enlightened with
the true knowledge of the Son of God, we may “all corne into
the unity of the faith.''(s) The preservation of the tmth,
therefore, from being extinguishcd in the world,is in conse·
quence of the Chnrch being its faithful guardian, by whose
efforts and ministry it is maintained. But if this guardianship
consiste in the ministry os the propheta and apostlea it follows
that it wholly depende on the faithful preservation of the purity
of the word of God. ,
ΧΙΙΙ. And that the readers may better understand upon what
point this question principally turns, lwill briefly state what our
adversaries require, and wherein wc oppose thern. When they
assert that the Church cannot err, their meaning is, aa they
themselves explain it, that as it is govemed by the Spirit of
God, it may safcly proceed without the word; that whither·
soever it goes, it can neither think nor speak any thing that ir
not true; and, therefore, that if it determina any thing beyond
or beside tha Divina word, the same is to be considered in uo
other light than as a certain oracle of (sort If we grant the
first point, that the Church cannot err in things essential to
salvation, our meaning is, that its security from error is owing
to its renouncing all its own wisdom, and submitting itself to
the Holy Spirit, to be taught by meausof the word of God.
This, then, is the difference between us. They ascribe to the
Ohurch an authority independent os the word, wc maintain it
ι to be annexed to the word, and inseparable from it. And what
is there snr rising that the sponse and disciple of Christ is subject
to her Lord and Master, so as to be assiduously and sedulously
awaiting his commanda and instructions? For it is the order of
awell regulatcd family, for the wife to obey the command of
the husband; it is the order of a well disciplined school, that
nothing be heard there but tha instmctions of the master.
