They have chanting and the pomp of ceremonias. But what
isall this to the purpose? 11 they plead custom, usage, pra·
scription of long continuance,1 will confront them with the
decisiou of Christ, where he has given us a description 31 true
presbyten, and what qualifications ought to be possessed by
those who wish to be considered as such. lf they cannot bear
33 hard alaw as to submit themselves to the rule of Christ,
let them at least allow this cause to be decided by the author·
ity of the primitive Church. But their condition will not be
at 311 better, if wejudge of their state by the ancient canons.
Those who have degenerated into canons, ought to be presby·
ters, as they were in former times, to govern the Church in
common with the bishop, aud to be his colleagues in the pas·
toral office. These chapter digrediar, as they 3311 them, have
‘ nothing todo with the government of the Church; much less
have the chaplainships, and the other dregs of similar offices.
In what estimation, then, shall we hold thern 311 i It is certain
that the word of Christ and the practice of the ancient Church
agree in excluding them from the honour of the presbytery.
'I'hey couteud, however, that they are presbyters; but the mask
must be torn off. Then we shall find, that their whole pro·
1333131 13 13331 foreign and remote from the office of presbytera,
which is described to us by the apostles, and which was re·
quired in the primitive Church. 1111 such orders, therefore, by
whatever titles they may be distinguished, since they are of
modern invention, or at least are not supported by the institu-
tion of God, or the ancient usage of the Church, ought to have

himself. Or, 11 they wish me tonse plaiuer language, since
chaplains, canons, deans, prorosts, and other idiers of tlris
description, do not even with their little fingere touch aparti-
cle of that duty which is necessarily required in presbytera, it
is not to be endured that they should falsely usurp the honour,
and thus violate the sacred institution 31 Jesus Christ.

XI. There remain the bishops aud the rectors of parishes,
who would afford me great pleasure if they exerted themselves
to support their office. For we would readily admit to them,
that they have a pious and honourable office, provided they
discharged it. But when they wish to be considered as pastore,
notwithstanding they desert the chnrches committed to thern,
and transfer the care 31 them to others, they act just as if the

office 31 3 pastor consisted in doing nothing. If a usurer, who
never stirred his foot out of the city, should profess himself a
ploughman or vinedresser, -if 3 soldier, who had spent 311 his
time in the camp and in tha field of battle, and had never seen
acourt of justice or books, should offer himself as a lawyer, —
