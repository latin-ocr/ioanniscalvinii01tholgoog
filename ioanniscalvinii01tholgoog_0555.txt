ΧΧΙ. It remaius for us, therefore, to acknowledge that, on
account of the affinity which the things signified have with
’ their symbols, the name of the substance has been given to the
sign, in a figurative sense indeed, but by a most apt arralogy.
Iforbear to introduce any thing of allegories and parables, lest
any one should accuse meos having recourse to subterfuges,
and travelling out of the present subject. lobserve that this
is a metonymical form of expression, which is commonly used
in the Scriptura in reference to sacraments. For in uo other
sense is it possible to understand such passages as these; when
of circumcisiou it is said, “This is my covenant ; '' (i) of the
paschal lamb, “It is the Lord’s passover;'’ (lc) of the legal
sacrifices, that they were expiations, or atonemeuts ; (l) of the
took, from which the water issued iu the desert, “ That Rock
was Christ.” (nt) And not only is the name of something su·
perior transferred to that which is inferior, but, on the contrary,
the name of the visible sign is likewise given to the thing sig-
nified3 as when God is said to have appeared to Moses in the
bush, (n) when the ark of the covenant is called God, (ο) and
the Holy Spirit, a dove. (p) For, though there is an essential
differeuce between the symbol and the thing siguified, the
former being corporeal, terrestrial, and visible, aud the latter
spiritual, celestial, and invisible, yet, as the symbol is not a
vain aud useless memoriale mere adumbration of the thing
which it has been consecrated to represent, but also a true and
real exhibition of it, why may not the name of that which it
signifies be justly applied to it? lf symbols invented by man,
which are rather emblems of things absent, than tokens of
things present, os which also they very frequently give a delu-
sive representation, are, neverthelcss, sometimes distinguished
by the names of the things which they signify, there is far
greater reason why the symbols instituted by God should bor·
row the names of those things of which they always exhibit a
correct and faithful representation, and by the tnrth of which
they are always accompanied. So great, therefore, is the simili·
tude and affinity of the one to the other, that there is nothing
at all urnratural in such a mutual interchange of appellatious.
Let our adversaries·cease, then, to assail us with their ridicu-
lous wit, hy calling us TropologistS, because we explain the
sacramental phraseology according to the common usage of tho
Scripture. For as there is a great similarity in marry respects
between the various sacraments, so this metonymical transfer
of names is common to them all. As the apostle, therefore,
statae, that “the Roclr '² from which flowed “spiritual drinlr '’
for· the IsraeliteS‚ “was Christ,’' (q) because it was a visible
