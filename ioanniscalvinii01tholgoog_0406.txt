remove, by a solemn declaration of repentance, the offence which
he has excited. The argument adduced by those who espouse a
contrary opinion, is os no force. They say, that Christ assigned
this office to the Church, when there was no magistrate to execute
it. But it frequently happens that the magistrate is too negli-
gent, and sometimes that he even deserves to be chastised
himself 3 which was the case with the emperor Theodosius.
Besides, the sarne argument might be extended to the whole
ministry of the word. Now, then, according to thern, pastors
must no longer censure notorious crirnes; they must cease to
chide, to reprove, to rebuke ; for there are Christian magistrates,
whose duty it is to correct such offences by the civil sword.
But as it is the duty of the magistrate, by punishment and
corporeal coercion‚ to purge the Church from offences, so it be-
hoves the minister of the word, on his part, to relieve the ma·
gistrate by preventing the multiplicationes offenders. Their
respective operatione ought to be so connected as to be an as·
sistance, and not aa obstruction to each other.

Christ, will easily perceive that they describe the stated and
perpetual order, and not any temporary regulation, of the
Church. For it is unreasonable for us to bring an accusation
before a magistrate, against those who refuse to submit to our
admonitions3 yet this would be necessary if the magistrate
succeeded to this office of the Church. What shall we say of
this promise, “ Verily 1 say unto thee, whatsoever ye shall bind
on earth, shall be bound in heaven? ” Was it only for one, or
for a few years? Besides, Christ here instituted nothing new,
but followed the custom always observed in the ancient Church
of his own nation; thereby signifying, that the spiritual juris·
diction, which had been exercised from the beginning, was
indispensable to the Church. And this has been confirmed by
the consent of all ages. For when emperors and magistrates
began to assume thc profession of Christianity, the spiritual
jurisdiction was not in consequence abolished, but only regu·
lated in such a manner as neither to derogate from the civil
power, nor to be confounded with it. And that justly; for a
picus magistrate will not wish to exempt himself from the
common subjection of the children of Cod, which in no small
degree consists in submitting to the Church, when it judges by
the word of God : so very far is it from being his duty to abolish

such a judicaturo. “ For what is more honourable,” says Arn-
brose, “ than for the emperor to be called the son of the Church l
For a good emperor is within the Church, not above the Church.’¹
Wherefore those who, to exalt the magistrate, despoil the Church

of this power, not only pervert the language of (Μὴ
interpretation, but pass a most severe censure on ·
