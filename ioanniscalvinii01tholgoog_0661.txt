upright litigator is very rare; but the thing itself ceases not to
be good and pure, if it be not defiled by an adventitious evil.
But when we hear that the assistance of the magistrate is a
holy gift of God, it behoves us to use the more assiduous
caution that it be not contaminated by our guilt.

XIX. Those who positively condemn all controversias at
law, ought to understand that they thereby reject a holy ordi·
nance of God, and a gift of the number of those which may
be “ pure to the pure ; ’² unless they mean to charge Paul with
a crime, who repelled the calumnies of his accusem, exposing
their subtlety and mallee, who, before his judges, asserted his
right to the privileges of a Roman citizen ; and who, when he
found it necessary, appealed from an unjust governor to the
tribunal of Caesar. lt is no objection to this that all Christians
are forbidden the desire of revenge, which we also wish to
banish to the greatest distance from all Christian judicatures.
For, in a civil cause, noman proceeds in the right way, who
does not, with innocent simplicity, commit his cause to the
judge as to a public guardian, without the least thought of a
mutual retaliation of evil, which is the passion of revenge.
And in any more important or crimina] action we require
the accuser to be one who goes into the court, influeuced by
no desire of revenge, affected by no resentment of private in·
jury, and having uo other motiva than to resist the attempts of
a mischievous man, that he may not injure the public. But if
aviudictive spirit be excluded, no offence is committed against
that precept by which revenge is forbidden to Christians. It
may probably be objected‚ that they are not only forbidden to
desire revenge, but are also commanded to wait for the haud of
the Lord, who promises that he will assist and revenge the af·
flicted and oppressed, and therefore that those who seek the inter· .
ference of the magistrate on behalf of themselves or others, anti-
cipate all that vengeance of the celestial protector. But this is
very far from the truth. For the vengeance of the magistrate
is to be considered, not as the vengeance of man, hut of God,
which, according to the testimony of Paulshe exercises by the
ministry of men for our good.

XX. Nor do we any more oppose the prohibition aud in·
junction of Christ, “Resist not evil; but whosoever shall
sinite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other als03 and
if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let
,him have thy cloak also.'' (d) ln this passage, indeed, lte
requires the minds of his servants to be so far from cherishing
adesire of retaliation, as rather to suffer the repetition os au
injury against themselves than to wish to revenge it, nor dc
