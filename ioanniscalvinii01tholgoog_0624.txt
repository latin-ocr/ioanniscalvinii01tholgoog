sacrament and the substance of the sacrament ; and remission
of sins is the substance only, and not the sacrament. Let those
who bear iu mind the definition of a sacrament which we have
already given, apply it to the examination of this pretended
sacrament, aud they will find that it is not an external cere·
many instituted by God sor the confirmation os our saith. If
they plead that my definition is not a law which they are
bound to obey, let them hear Augustius, whom they profess to
regard with the greatest reverence. He says, “ Visible sacra·
ments are instituted sor carnal persons, that by the steps of the
sacramente they may be led lrom those things which are visible
to the eye, to those which are intelligible to the miud.” What
resemblance to this do they themselves see, or are they able to
point out to others, in that which they call the sacrament os
penancei The same writer says in another place, “It is
therefore called a sacrament, because one thing is seen, another
is understood in it. That which is seen has corporeal sorm;
that which is understood has spiritual fruit.’' These things
are not at all applicable to the sacrament of penance, which
they have invented, in which there is no corporeal form to
represent any spiritual fnvit.

XVI. And to vanquish these champions on their own
ground, if any sacrament be sought for here, would it notbe far
more plausible to say that the sacrament consiste in the absolu·
tion os the priest, rather than in penitence, either internal or
external? For it would be easy to say, that this is a ceremony
appointed lor the confirmation of our saith in the remissiori of
sins, and has what they call the promise of the heys: “ What·
soever ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven,· and
whatsoever ye shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaveu.'' (y)
But some would have objected, that many who are absolved
by priests, darive no such benefits from their absolution;
whereas, upon their principle, the sacramente ol the new law ac-
tually accomplish that which they represent. To this it might
be replied, that, as in the eucharist there is a twot'old eating, -
sacramental, which is equally common to the good and the
wicked3 and spiritual, which is peculiar to the good—why
might they not also imagine the reception os a twosold absolu·
tion? Yet l have never yet been able to comprehend what
they intended by that principle of theirs, respecting the effica-
cious virtue os the sacramente of the new law3 which we have
proved to be altogether at variance with the truth ot God,
when we professedly discussed that subject. Here 1 only
mean to show that this difficulty is no objection to their
calling sacerdotal absolution a sacrament. For they might
