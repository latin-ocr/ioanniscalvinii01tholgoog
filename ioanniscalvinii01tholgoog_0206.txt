many arguments are advanoed on both sides, let our conclusion
be to stand astonished with Paul at so great a mystery‚ end
amidst the clamour os petulant tongues let us not be ashamed
oi exclaiming with him, “ O man, who art thou that repliest
against God l '' For, as Angustiae justly contenda, it is acting
amost perverse part, to set up the measure of human justice
as the standard by which to measure the justice os God.

Tuouon Christ, the Sun oi Righteousness, aiter having
