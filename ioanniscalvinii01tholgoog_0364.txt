sus, he says, “l know this, that after my departing shall griev-
ous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock; also ot‘
your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to
draw away disciples aster them.'' (a) ll tha pastors could so
degenerata in avery short space of tima, what enormous cor·
ruption might be introduced among them in a long series os
years! hud not to occupy much room with an enumeratiou,
we are taught by the examples of almost all ages, that neither
is the truth always maintained in the bosom of the pastors,
nor the sasety of the Church dependent on their stability.
'l'hey ought, indeed, to be the guardians and defenders of the
peace and sasety of the Church‚ for the preservation ol which
they are appointed; but it isone thing to perform a duty which
we owe, and another, to owe a duty which we do not perform.

V. Let no person conclude from what lhave said, thatl
am inclined on all occasions, aud without any discrimination‚
to wealren the authority os pastors, and bring it into contempt.
I only mean to suggest the necessity os discriminating between
some pastors and others, that we may not immediately consider
persons as pastors because they bear that title. But the pope
aud all his bishops, for no other reason but because they are
called pastors, casting off all obedience to the word os God,
disturb and coniound every thing at their own plescum, while
they labour to persuade us that it is impossible sor them to be
destitute os the light of truth, that the Spirit of God perpetually
resides in them, aud that with them the Ohurch lives aud dies.
As though the Lord had now no judgments, to inflict upon the
world, iu the present day, the same kind of punishment, with
which he once visited the ingratitude oi his ancient people ; (o)
uainely, to amite the pastors with astonishment, madness, aud
blindness. And such is their extreme stupidity, they are not
aware that they are acting the same part which was acted by
those who resisted the word os the Lord in ancient times. For
thus the enemies of Jeremiah sortified themselves in opposition
to the truth: “ Come, and let us devise devices against Jere-
miah; sor the law shall not perish frona the priest, nor counsel
from the wise, nor the word from the prophet.'’ (p)

Vl. Hence it is easy to reply to another plea in bahali ot* geu-
eral couucils. That atruc Church existed among the Jews in
the time of the prophets, cannot be deuied. But is ageneral
cotrucil os the priests had been convened, what appearance of a
Ohurch would such a couucil have displayedi We hear what
God denouuces, not against two or three oi them, but against the
whole body: “ 'l'he priests shall beastonished, andthe propheta
