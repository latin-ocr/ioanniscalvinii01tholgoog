X. But when the saints sometimes appear to urge their own
righteousness as an argument in their supplicatione with God,
-as when David says, ‘⁸ Preserve my soul ς for I am holy 3 ” (d)
and Hezekiah, “l beseech thee, O Lord‚ remember now howl
have walked before thee in tmth, and have done that which is
good in thy sight,” (e)-their only design in such modes of ex·
pressiori is, from their regeneration to prove themselves to bc
servants and sons of God, to whom he declares he will be pro·
pitious. He tells us by the Psalmist, (as we have already seem)
that “his eyes are upon the righteouS, and that his ears are
open unto their cry; ''( s ) and again, by the apostle, that
“ whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
commandments3 ’³ (g) in which passages he does not determine
the value of prayer according to the merit of works; but
intends by them to establish the confidence of those who are
conseious to themselves, as all believers ought to be, of
unseigned integrity and innocence. For the observation in
John, made by the blind man who received his sight, that
“ God heareth not sinners,'' (b) is a principle of Divine nuth,
if we understand the word sinam, in the common acceptation
of Scripture, to signisy those who are all asleep and content in
their sins, without any desire of righteousness; since no beart

panied with aspiratione after piety. To such promises, there- -

fore, correspond those declaratione of the saints, in which they
introduce the mention of their own purity or innocence, that
they may expericnce a manifestation to themselves of what is
to be expected by all the servants of God. Resides, they are
generally found in the use of this species of prayer, when before
the Lord they compare themselves with their enemies, from
whose iniquity they desire him to deliver them. Now, in this
comparison, we need not wonder, if they produce their right·
eousness and simplicity of heart‚ in order to prevail upon him
by the justice of their cause to yield the more ready assist-
ance. We object not, therefore, to the pious heart of a good
man making use before the Lord of the consciousness of his
own purity for his confirmation in the promises which the Lord
has given for the consolation and support of his true worship-
pers; but his confidence of success we wish to bc independent
of every consideration of personal merit, and to rest solely on
the Divina clemency.
