ferred? Certainly not to the pope, as he impudently presumas
to boast, when he assumes this title to himself ; but to Christ,
who exercises that office alone without vicar or successor, and
resigns the honour to no other. For this priesthood, which
was prefigured in the law, consists not only in preaching or
doctrine, but in the propitiation of God, which Christ affected
in his death, and in that intercession which he is now making
with the Father.

111. There is no reason, therefore, why they should confine
us to this example, as if it were a law perpetually binding,
whereas wc see it was only of temporary duration. From the
New 'I'estameut they have nothing to adduce in support of their
opinion, but that it was said to one, “Thou art Peter; and
upon this rock I will build my Church.” (r) Again: “ Peter,
lovest thou me? Feed my sheep.’'(s) But to render thes'e
proofs substantial, it is necessary for them first to show that he
who is commanded to seed the flock of Christ, is invested with
authority over all charchas, and that binding and loosing are no
other than governing the whole world. But as Peter had re·
ceived the command from the Lord to feed the Chnmh, so he cx-
horts all other presbyters to do the same. (t) Hence it is easy to
infer, that· this charge of Christ conferred nothing peculiar upon
Peter beyond others, or that Peter communicated equally to
others the right which he had received. But, not to disputa to
no purpose, we have in another place, from the mouth of Christ
himself, a clear explanation of what he intends by binding and
loosing, namsly, “remitting and retaining sins.'’ (v) The man·
ner of binding and loosing is shown by the whole tenor of
Scriptura, and particularly by Paul, when he says that the minis·
tcrs of the gospel have received a commission to reconcile men
to God, (ro) and that they have authority to inflict punishment
on those who shall reject this favour. (a)

IV. How grossly they pervert those passages which make
mention of binding and loosing, 1 have hinted before, and shall

¹ hereafter have to state more at large. At present it is worth

while to see what they can extract from that celebrated an·
swer of Christ to Peter. He promised him “the keys of the
kingdom of heaven.’' He said, “ Whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth, shall be bound in heaven.” (y) lf we can agree re·
specting the word keys, and the manner of binding, all disputa
will immediately cease. For the pope himself will readily
relinquish the charge committed to the apostles, which, being
fullos labour and trouble, would deprive him of his pleasures
without yielding him any profit. Since it is the doctrine of
