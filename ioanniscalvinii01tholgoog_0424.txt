proper limits. ln this respect, it is impossible to excuse the ex-
cessive austerity of the ancieuts, which was utterly at variance
with the directions 01 the Lord, and led to the most dangeroua
consequences. For when they sentenced an offender to solemn
repentance, and exclusion from the holy communion, some
times for three, sometimes for four, sometimes for seven years,
and sometimes 101 the remainder 01 life,-what other conse·
quence could result from it, but either great hypocrisy 01 extreme
despair? In like manner, when any one had fallen 8 second
time, the refusal 10 admit him 10 8 second repentance, and his
exclusion from the Church 10 the end 01 his life, was neither use·
ful nor reasonable. Whoever considers the subject with sound
judgment, therefore, will discover their want of prudence in this
instance. But I would rather reprobate the general custom,
than accuse all those who practised it; among whom it is
certain that some were not satisfied‚ but they complied with
it because it was 801 in their power to effecta reformation.
Cyprian declares that it was not from his own choice that he
was so rigoroua “Our patience,” he says, “and kindness
and tendemess, is ready 101 811 who corne. 1 wish 811 10 return
into the Church: 1 wish all 081 fellow-soldiers to be assembled
in the camp of Christ, and all our brethren to be received into

with rigid severity3 and am scarcely free from fault myself,
in sorgiving faults more easily than 1 ought. With ready and
entire 8110011081 embrace those who return with penitence,
confessing their sin with humble and sincere satisfaction.''
Chrysostom is rather more severe; yet he expresses himself thus:
“If God is so kind, why is his priest determincd 10 be so
austere l '' We know, likewise, what kindness Augustine ex·
ercised towards the Donatists, 80 that he hesitated not to
receive into the bishoprics those who renounced their err0r3
and that immediately after their repentance. But because 8
contrary system had prevailed, they were obliged to relinquish
their own judgment, in order 1ο follow the established custom.

IX. Now, 8811 18 required 01 the whole body 01 the Ohurch,
in chastising any one who has fallen, 10 manifest such gentle·
ness aud clemency as not 10 proceed to the extremity 01 rigour,
but rather, according to the injunction of Paul, to “confirm
their love toward him,'' (n) so it is the duty of every indi·
vidual to moderate himself to the like tendemess and clemeucy.
Such as 810 expelled from the Church, therefore, it is not for
