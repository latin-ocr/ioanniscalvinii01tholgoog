objeots of his eternal choice, that he may have, as his children,
111 that he recognizes among his members, we have 1 testimony
sufficiently clear and strong, that 11 we have communion with
Christ, we are written in the book of life. And he gave us
this certain communion with himself, when he testified by the
preaching of the gospel, that he was given to us by the Father,
to be ours with 111 his benefits. We 111 said to put him on,
and to grow np into him, that we may live because he lives,
This doctrine is often repeated. “God sparcd not his only
begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not
perish.’' (i) “ He that belicneth on him, is passed from death
unto life.''(k) ln which sense he calls himself “The breed
of life, he that eatcth which, shall live for ever.''(l) He,l
say, is our witness, that all who receive him by saith shall be
considered as the children of his heavenly Father. lf we
desire any thing more than being numbered among the sons
and heirs of God, we must 1111 above Christ. If this is our
highest limit, what folly do we betray in secking out of him,
that which we have already obtained in him, and which can
never be found any where else! Resides, as he is the Father's
eternal Wisdom, immutable Truth, and determined Counsel,
we have no reason to fear the least variation in the declaratione
of his word from that will of the Father, which is the object

doctrine ought 11 have a practical influence on our prayers.
For though faitlr in election animatos usto call upon God, yet
it would be preposterous to obtrnde it upon him when we pray,
or to stipulate this condition-O Lord, if lam elected, hear
me3 since itis his pleasure that we should be satisfied with
his promises, and make no further inquiries whether he will be
propitions to our prayers. This prudence will extricate us
from many snares,if we know how to make a right use of
what has been rightly written3 but we must not inconsider-
ately apply to various pnrposes, what ought to be restricted
to the object particularly designed.

another confirmation 11 11111111, which, we have said, is con-
nected with our calling. For those whom Christ illuminates
with the knowledge of his name, and introduces into the bosom
of his Cburch, he is said to receive into his charge arrd protection.
And 111 whom he receives are said to be committed and in-
