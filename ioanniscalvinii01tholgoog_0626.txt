resort to uncertain testimonias? Nothing can be required more
explicit than what is recited by the evangelists, thet “John
dtis pryzayh the baptism of repentance for the remission of

XVIII. The third counterfeit sacrament is extreme unction;
which is never performed but by a priest, and that in the last
momenta os lise, with oil consecrated by a bishop, and the fol-
lowing formos words: “By this holy unction, and by his most
tendor mercy, may God pardon thee whatever sin thou hast
committed by sight, by hearIng, by srnell, by teste, and by
touch.’' 'l'hey pretend that it has two virtues—remission os
sinS, and relies srorn bodily discsse, tr that be expedient, or
otherwise tho salvation of the soul. They say that the insti-
tution os it is established by James, who says, “ Is any siclr
among you? let him call sor the elders ot' the Church 3 and let
thern pray over him, anoirrtiog him with oil in the name ol the
Lord3 and the prayer os saith shall save the siclt, and the Lord
shall raiae him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall
be forgiven him.’'(a) 'l'his unction os theirs is ot' the same
lrind as we have already proved their imposition ot hands to be:
it is a mere hypocritical sarce, by which, without any reason,
aud without any advantage, they effect to mimic the apostles.
Itis related by Mark, that the apostles, at their first inission, ac-
cording to the command which they had received from the Lord,
raised the dead, ejected demens, cleanaed lepers, healed the sick,
and that in the cure of the siclr they made use of oil. “ 'l'hey
anointed with oil,’' ho says, “many thet were sich, and healed
them.”(b) Jarnes had this in view when he directed the elders
of the Church to he sent sor to anoint the sick. That such cere-
monies concealed no higher mystery, will easily ba concluded by
any attentive observers of the great liberty used by our Lord
and his apostles in externat things. When our Lord was about
to restore sight to a blind man, he mede clay of dust and
spittle; some he healed with a touch, others with a word.
In the same manner, the apostles cured some maledies with a
mere word, others withatouch, others with unction. But it
may be alleged that it is probeble that this unction, like the
other methods, was not employed without reason. 'l'hisl
confess; not, however, that they used it as an instmment of
cure, but merely as a sign, to instruct the ignorance os the
simple whence such virtue proceeded, that they might not
ascribe the praise of it to the apostles. Now, it isvery common
