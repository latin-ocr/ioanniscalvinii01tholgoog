Oburch: “ Lord, who shall abide iu thy tabemacle? who slull
dwell in thy holy hill? He tbst walketh uprightly, md
worketh righteousness, '' dcc. (r) Audin Imiab: “ Wbo shall
dwell with the devouring lire? He that walketb rigbteously,
aud speaketh uprightly,''dce. (s) For these psmages describe,
not the foundation which supporta the faithful before God, but
the manner in which their most merciful Father introduces
them into communion with him, and preserves aud confirma
them iu it. For as he detests sin, and loves righteousuess,
those whom he nnites to him be purifica by his Spirit, iu ordor
to conform thern to himself aud his kingdom. Therefore, if it
be inquired what istbe first cause which gives the saints an
entrance into the kingdom of God, and which makes their
contiuuauce in it permanent, the answer is ready3 Because
the Lord in his mercy has once adopted and perpetually
defends them. But if the q estion relate to tbe manner in
which he does this, it will heu be necessary to edvert to
regeneration and its fruita, which are enumerated in the psalm
that we bave just quoted.

VII. But there appears to be much greater difficulty in those
places which dignify good werke witb the title of aglema-
πως, and assert that a man is justified by thena Of the former
kind there are many, where the observance of the commanda
is denominated justificotion or rigkteousness. An example of
the other kind we find iu Moses: ‘⁴ And it shall be our right·
eousnesa if we observa to do all these commandmenta’' (t) lf
it be objected that this isa legal promise, which, havingan
impossible condition annexed to it, proves nothing—there are
other passages which will not admit of a similar reply; such
aa, “ ln case thou shalt deliver him the pledge, dcc, it shall ba
righteousness unto thee before the Lord.'’ (u) Similar to this
is what the Psalmist says, that the zeal of Phinehaa in aveng-
ing the disgrace of Israel, “was counted uuto him for right·
eousness.”(w) Theresore the Pharisees of our day suppose
that these passages afford ample ground for their elamour
against us. For when we say, that if the righteousness of
faith be established, there is an endof justificatiou by works, -
they argue, in the same manner, that if rightcousness be by
works, thenit isnot true that we are justified by faitlr alone.
Though I grant that tho precepts of tho law are termed sigtr-
eousuess, there is nothing surprising in this; for they arc so iu
reality. The reader, however, ought to be apprined that tlre
Hebrew word :upa (conunoudmeuts) is not well translated by
the Greek word ltmapaea, (rigbteoasness.) But lreadily reliu-
