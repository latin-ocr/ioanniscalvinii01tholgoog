of their duty on this subject. First, then, let them remember
that when they inquire into predestination, they penetrate the
inmost recesses os Divina wisdom, where the carelese and
confident intruder will obtain no satisfaction to his curiosity,
but will enter a labyrinth from which he will find no way to
depart. For it is unreasouable that man should scrutinize with
hell‘t‘lntllnllltlllnllltllell'll§nh
sublimity of wisdom which God would haye us to adore and
not comprehend, to promote our admiration os his glory. 'Phe
secreta os his will which he determined to reveal to us, he
discovers in his word 3 and these are all that he soresaw would
concern ns or condoce to our advantage.

11. “We ars come into the way os saith,” says Augustiu03
“let us constantly pursue it. lt conducts into the king’a
palace, iu which are hidden all the treasures os wisdom and
knowledge. For the Lord Christ himself envied not his great
and most select disciples when he said, ‘1 have many things to
say nuto you, but ye cannot bear them now) We must welk,

to be seen os him, this consideration will easily restrain and
preserve us from all presumption. For we shall know that
when we hare exceeded the limite of the word, we shall get
into a devious and darksome course, in which errore, slips, and
falls, will often be inevitable. Let us, then, in the first place,
hear in mind, that to desire any other knowledge os predestina-
tion than what ia unfolded in the word of God, indicates as
great solly, as a wish to welk through unpessable roeds, or to
see in the darh. Nor let us be ashamed to be ignorant os sorus
things relative to a subject in which there is a kind os learned
ignorance. Rather let us abstain with cheeri'ulness from the
pursuit os that knowledge, the affectation os which is scolish,
dengerous‚ and even fatal. But 11 we are stimulated by the
wantonness of intellect, we must oppose it with a reflection
calculated to repress it, that ss “it is not good to eat much
honey, so formeri to search their own glory, is not glory.” (li)

can only precipitare us into ruin.
