which are not without the knowledge of some witnesses, and
yet are not public. The first sort requires not the adoption of
the gradual measures enumerated by Christ3 but it is the duty
of the Chureh, on the occurrence of any notorious scandal,
immediately to summon the offender, and to punish him in
proportion to his crima. Sius of the second class, according
to the rule of Christ, are not to be brought before the Chureh,
unless they are attended with contumacy‚ in rejecting private
admonitiou. When they are submitted to the eognizance of
the Chureh, theu attention is to be paid to the other distinc-
tion, between smaller delinqueneies and more atrocibus crimes.
For slighter offences require not the exertion of extreme se·
verity; it is sufficient to administer verbal castigation, aud
that with patemal gentleuess, not calculated to exasperate or
eonfound the offender, but to bring him to himself, that his
correction may be an occasion of joy rather than of sorrow.
But it is proper that flagitious crimes should receive severer
punishment3 for it is not enough for him who has grievously
offended the Church by the bad example of au atrocious crime,
merely to receive verbal castigation3 he ought to be deprived
of the communiones the Lord’s supper for a time, till he shall
have given satisfactory evidence of repentance. For Paul not
only employs verbal reproof against the Corinthian transgressor,
but excludes him from the Chureh, aud blames the Corin·

thians for having tolerated him so long. This order was ,

retained in tha ancient and purer Chureh, while any legitimate
govemment continued. For if any one had perpetrated a
crime which was productiva of offence, he was commanded, in
the first place, to abstain from the Lord’s supper, and, in the
next place, to humble himself before God, aud to testify his
repentance before the Ohurch. There were, likewise‚ certain
solemn rites which it was customary to enjoin upon those who
had fallen, as signs of their repentance. When the sinner had
performed these for the satisfaction of the Chureh, he was
then, by imposition of hands, readmitted to the communion.
This readmission is frequently called peace by cyprian, who
briefly describes the ceremony. “They do penance,’' he says,
“ for a sufficient time3 then they come to confession, aud by
the impositiones the hands of the bishop and clergy, are re·
stored to the privilege of communion.'’ But though the bishop
and clergy presided in the reconciliation of offenders, yet they
required the consent of the people; as Cyprian elsewhere
states.

princes and plebeians yielded the same submission to it ; and
