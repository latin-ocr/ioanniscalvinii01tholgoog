believe, because this curse of God was upon them. (s ) Nor
can it be disputed, that to such persons as God determines not
to enlighten, he delivers his doctrine involved in enigmatical
obscurity, that its only effect may be to increase their stupidity.
For Christ testifies that he confiued to his apostles the expla· ’
nations of the parables iu which he had addressed the multi·
tude; “because to you it is given to know the mysteries ot' the
kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given.’'(g) What
does the Lord mean, you will say, by teaching those by whom
he takes care not to be understood? Consider whence the
fault arises, and you will cease the iuquiry ; sor whatever
obscurity there is in the word, yet there is always light enough
to convince the consciences os the wicked.

XIV. It remeius now to be seen· why the Lord does that
which it is evident he does. If it be replied, that this is done
because men have deserved it by their impiety, wickedness, and
ingratitudo, it will be a just and true observation; but as we
have not yet discovered the reason os this diversity, why some
persist in obduraoy while others are inclined to obedience, tho
discussion of it will necessarily lead usto the same remark that
Paul has quoted from Moses concoming Pharaoh: “Even for
this same purpose have Ι raised thee up, that 1 might show my
power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout
all the earth.'’ (lt) That the reprobate obey not the word ot'
God, when made known to them, is justly imputed to the
wickedness and depravity os their hearts, provided it be at the
same time stated, that they are abandoned to this depravity,
because they have been raised up, by a just but inscrutable
judgment of God, to display his glory in their condemnation.
So, when it is related of the sons os Eli, that they listened not
to his salutary admonitione, “because the Lord would slay
them,'’ (i) it is not denied that their obstinacy proceedcd
from their own wickedness, but it is plainly implied that
though the Lord was able to soften their hearts, yet they were
lest in their obstinacy, because his immutable decree had pre·
destinated them to destruction. To the same purpose is that
passage os John, “Though he had done so mauy miracles
before them, yet they believed not on him; that the saying ol
Esaias the prophet might be sulfilled, which he spake, ‘Lord,
who hath believed our report? ’'' (lc) For though he does not
acquit the obstinate from the charge of guilt, yet he satisfias
himself with this reason, that the grace ol God has no ‚cherma
formeri till the HolySpirit gives them ateste sor it. And
Christ cites the prophecy os Isaieh, ‘⁴ They shall be all ,taught
