of a promise. That there is nothing of this kind in matrimony
even children can judge. But, they say, it is a sign of a sacred
thing, thetis, of the spiritual union of Christ with the Church.
If by the word sign, they mean a symbol presentedeto us by
God to support our saith, they are very sar from the truth. lf by
a sign they merely understand that which is adduced as asimili-
tude, l will show how acutely they reason. Paul says, “ One
star differeth from another star in glory: so also is the resurrec-
tion of the dead. (n) Here isone sacrament. Christ says,
“ The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain os mustard seed.”
Here is another. Again: “The kingdom of heaven is like
untoleaven.'’ (o) Here isathird. lsaiah says, “Behold, the
Lord shall seed his flock like a shepherd.'’(p) Here is a
fourth. Again: “The Lord shall go forth as a mighty man.'’ (q)
Here is a fifth. And what end will there be? Upon this
principle, every thing will be a sacrament, as many parables
aud similitudes as there are iu the Scripture, there will be so
many sacramenta Even thest will be a sacrament; because
it is written, “The day of the Lord cometh as a thief.”(r)
Who can bear the soolish babblings os these sophists? Iconsess
indeed, that, whenever we see a vine, it is very desirable to
recall to remembrarrce the language os Christ: “l arn the vine,
ye are the branchos, and my Father is the husbandmen.’' (s)
Whenever we meet a shepherd with his flock, it is good for us
to remember another declaration of our Lord: “l am the good
shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.'’ (t)
But is any one should class such similitudes among the sacra-
ments, it would argue a wantos mental sanity.

XXXV. They obtrude upon us the language of Paul, in
which, they say, he expressly calls matrimony a sacrament.
“He that loveth his wife, loveth himself. For no man ever
yet hated his own flesh; but nourisheth and cherisheth it,
even as the Lord the Church; sor we are mernbers of his body,
of his flesh, and his bones, t'or this cause shall a man leave
his father and mother, and shall be joined tutto his wife, and
they two shall be one flesh. This is a great mystery (or so·
orantem, as the word is rendered in the Vulgare 3) but Ι speak
concerning Christ and the Church.''(u) But to treat the

. Scriptores iu this manner, is to confound heaven and earth to-

gether. To show to husbands what peetrliar affection they

ought to bear to their wiveS, Paul proposes Christ to thomas

arr example. Foras he has poured forth all the treasures of his

kindness upon the Church, which he had espoused to himself,

so the apostle would have every man to evince a similar affec·

tion towards his wife. lt follows, “ He that loveth his wife,
