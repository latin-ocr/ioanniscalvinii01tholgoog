will they say ol all the ancient fathers, who, it is certain, not
only tolerated marriage in bishops, but likewise approved of
it? lt would follow that they must have practised a foul
profanation of sacred things, since, according to the notion we
are opposing, they did not celebrate the mysteries os the Lord
with the requisita purity. 'Phe injunction os celibacy was
agitated in the council of Nice, lor there are never wanting
little minda, absorbed in superstition, who endeavour to make
themselves admired by the invention of some novelty. But
what was the decisioni 'I'he council coincided in the opinion
os Paphnutius, who pronounced that “a man’s cohabitation
with his own wife is chastity.’' 'Pherefore marriage con-
tinued to be held sacred among them, nor was it esteemed
any disgrace to them, or considered as casting any blemish on
the ministry.

XXVII. Afterwards followed times distinguished by a too
superstitious admiration of celibacy. Hence those frequent
and extravagant encomiums on virginity, with which scarcely
any other virtue was in general deemed worthy to be compared.
And though marriage was not condemned as impure, yet its
dignity was so diminished, and its sanctity obscured, that he
who did not refrain from it was not considered as aspiring to
perlection with sufficient fortitude of mind. Hence those
canons, which prohibited the contractiori of marriage by those
who had already entered on the office os priests ; and succeed-
ing ones, which prohibited the admission to that office of any
but those who had never been married, or who had abjured all
cohabitation with their wives. Because these things seemed
to add respectability to the priesthood‚ they were received, 1
consess, even in early times, with great applause. But our
adversaries object antiquity against us. 1 answer, ln the
first place, in the days of the apostles, and for several ages
after, the bishops were at liberty to marry, and the apostles
themselves, as well as other pastors os the highest reputation
who succeeded them, made use os this liberty without any
difficulty. 'Phe example of the primitive Church we ought to
hold in higher estimation than to deem that unlawsul or un·
becoming which was then received and practised with appro-
bation. Secondly3 even that age, which, iroma superstitious
attachment to virginity, began to be more unsavourable to
marriage, did not impose the law of celibacy upon the priests as
is it were absolutely necessary, but because they preferred
celibacy to marriage. Lastly; this law did not require the
compulsion os continence in those who were not ableto keep
it; sor while the severest punishments were denounced ort
priests who were guilty os fornication, those who married vete

merely dismissed from their office. ι ¹ Ἀ
