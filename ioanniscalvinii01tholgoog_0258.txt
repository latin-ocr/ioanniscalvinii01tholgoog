in a comparison between lshmael and lsaac, he represents many
as occupying a place in the Church, who have no right to the
inheritance, because they are not the children of a free mother.
Hence he proceeds to a contrast of the two Jerusalem, because
as the law was given on Mount Sinai, but the gospel came
forth from Jerusalem, so many who have been born and edu·
cated ιιι bondage, confidently boast of being the children of God
and of the Church, aud though they are themselves a spurious
offspring, look down with contempt on his genuine and legiti-
mate children. But as for us, on the contrary, who have once
heard it proclaimed from heaven, “Cast out the bondwoman
and her son,” let us confide in this inviolable decree, and reso-
lutely despise their ridiculous pretcnsions. For if they pride
themselves on an external profession, lshmael also was circum-
cised. If they depend on antiquity, he was the first born
Yet we see that he was rejected. lf the cause of this be ιιι-
quirod, Paul tells us that none are aecouuted children but those
who are born of the pure and legitimare seed of the word. (m)
According ιο this reason, the Lord declares that he is not con·
fined to impious priests, because he had made acovcnant with

their father Levi to be his angel or messenger. (n) He even ·

retorts on them their false beasting, with which they were
accustomed to oppose the prophets, that the dignity of the
priesthood ought to be held in peculiar estimation. Thisbe
readily admits, and argues with thern on this ground, because
he was prepared to observe the covenant, whereas they failed
of discharging the correspondent obligations, and therefore de·
served to be rejected. See, theu, what such succession is
worth, unless it be connected with a continual imitation and
conformity. Without this, the descendants, who are convicted
of a departure from their predecessore, must immediately be
deprived of all honour; unless, indeed, because Caiaphas was
the successor of many pious priests, and there had been an
uninterrupted series even from Aaron to him, that execrable
assembly be deemed worthy to be called the Chnrch. But it
would not be tolerated even in earthly govemments, that tha
tyranny of Caligula, Nero, Heliogabalus, aud others, should be
called the true state of the republic, because they succeeded
tho Bruti, the Scipios, and the Camilli But in re gard to the

govemment of the Church, nothing can be more frivgolous than
to place the succession in the persons, to the neglectos the
doctrine. And nothing was further from the intentioris of the
holy doctore, whose authority they salsely obtrude upon us,
than to prove that Churches existed by a kind of hereditary
right, whatever there has been a constant succession of biahops.
