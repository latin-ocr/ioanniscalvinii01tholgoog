and that these are tha ordinances which have been received by
usage and cnstom without the Scriptura But what effrontcry
is here betrayed! loonfess that the disciples were ignorant,
and not very docile, when the Lord made this declaration to
them; but they were not so stupid, when they committed their
doctrine to writing, as to render it necessary for them after·
wards to supply in their discourses what they had from igno·
rance omitted in their writings. But is, when they published
their writings, they had already been led by the Spirit iuto all
truth, what hindered thern from comprising aad leaving on
record in those writings a perfect system ol evangelical doc·
trine? Let us grant our opponente, however, what they
ask: only let them enumerate those things which required to
be revealed, and are not contained in the apostolioal writings.
If they dare to attempt this, 1 will reply in the words of Au·
gastine, “Whare the Lord has been silent, which of us can
say, These things or those are intended; and il he dare to say
so, how will he prove it?” But why do 1 contend a point
thetis unnaccssary? For even children know that the apos-
tolic writings, which these men represent as incompleta and
essentially deficient, contain the fruit ol that revelation which
the Lord then promised thern.

XV. What, say they, did not Christ place the doctrines aud
decrees os the Church beyond all controversy, when he corn-
manded him who should dare to contradict it, to be regarded
“as a heathcn man and a publican?’' (a) In the first place,
Christ in that text makes no mention ol doctrinabat only
asserta the authority of the Church in pronouncing censuras for
the correction ol vices, in order that its judgment may not be
opposed by any who are admonished or reproved. But leaving
this remark, it is astonishing, that they have no more modesty
than to presumo to boast os that passage. For what will they
extort from it, but that it is unlawsnl to despise the consent of
the Church, which nevar consents to any thing except the
truth os the word of God? The Church is to be heard, they
say. Who denies it? For it pronounces nothing bnt from the
word of the Lord. If they require any thing further, let them
know that these words of Christ afford them no support. Nor
ought it to be esteemed too contentious in me to insist so strenn-
ously on this point-That it is not lawful for the Church to in-
vent any new doctrine, or to teach and deliver, as of Divina au·
thority, any thing more than the Lord has revealed in his word.
