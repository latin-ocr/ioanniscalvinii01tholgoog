descend from thet secret adoptiou3 as Isaiah introduces them,
sayiug, ‘¹ Thou hast done wonderful things3 thy conusels os
old are faithfulness aud truth;'' (g) for by adoption, as by a
tokeu, God chooses to confirm to us all that we are peuuitted
to know of his counsel. Lest this should be thought a weak
testimony, let us consider how much clearuess aud certainty it
affords us. Bernard has some pertinent observatious ou this
subject. After speaking of the reprobate, he says, “The coun-
sel of God stands, the sentence of peace stands, respectiug them
who sear him, concealing their faults aud rewardiug their
virtues; so that to theru, not only good things, but evil oues
also, coiiperate for good. Who shall lay any thing to the
charge of God’s elect? It is sufficient sor me, for all righteous-
uess, to possess his favour alone, against whom alone 1 have
sinned. All that he has decreed not to imputo to me, is just
as if it hed uever been.'' And a little after: “0 place of true
rest, which I might not improperly call a bed—chamber, in
which God is viewed, not as disturbed with anger, or filled
with care, but where his will is proved to be good, aud accept·
able, aud perfect. This view is not terrifying, but soothiug3
it excites no restless curiosity, but allays it ς it fatigues not tbe
sauses, but tranquillizes them. Here true rest is enjoyed.
A tranquil God tranquillizes all things3 aud to behold rest, le
to eujoy repose.''

V. In the first place, if we seek tlte fatherly clemency and
propitious heart of God, otu eyes rnnst be directed to Christ, in
whom alone the Father is well pleased. (n) lf we seek salve·
tion, life, and the immortality of the* heavenly kingdom, re·
course must be had to no other; for he alone is the Fountain
of life, the Auchor of salvation, and the Heir of the kingdom
of heaven. Now, what is the end of electiori, but that, being
adopted as children by our heaveuly Father, we may by his
favour obtain salvation aud immortality? Consider aud iuves·
tigate it as much as you please, you will not fiud its ultimate
scope extend beyond this. The persons, therefore, whom God
has adopted as his children, he is said to have chosen, notin
themselves, but iu Christ; because it was impossible for him
to love them, except in him; or to honour them with the
iuheritauce of his kingdom, unless previously mede partakers
of him. But if we are choseu in him, we shall find uo assu·
rauce of ourelectiou iu ourselves; nor even iu God the Father,
considered alone, abstractedly from the Son. Christ, therefore,
is the miuor, iu which it behoves us to contemplate our eleo·
tiou3 and here we may do it with safety. For as the Father
has determined to unite to the body of his Son all who ers the
