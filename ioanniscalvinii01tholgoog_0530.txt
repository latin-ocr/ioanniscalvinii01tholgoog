Spirit;” which, though we were to admit as a genuine text,
yet he could infer nothing more from it, than that believers are
formed to obedience as the Spirit operatas within thern. But
that which is affirmed of a certain number, it is wrong to apply
equally to all. t He objects, that because “that is first
which is natural,”(lr) tue ought to wait the, proper time for
baptism, which is spiritual. Now, though 1 grant that all the
descendants of Adam, being carnal, bring their condemnation
into the world with thern, yet 1 derry that this is any impedi·
ment to the communication of a remedy, as soon as ever
God is pleased to impert it. For Servetus can show no
Divine appointment, that many years shall elapse before the
newness of spiritual life can begiu; for according to the testi·
mony of Paul, though the infant children of believers are in a
ruined condition by nature, yet they are sanctified by super·
natural grace. (i) 6. He next produces an allegory, that when
David went up to the fortress of Zion, he toolr with him
neither the blind nor the lame, but hardy soldiers. (k) And
what if Ι oppose him with a parable, in which God invites
the blind and the larnc to the celestial feast? (l) how will he
extricate himself from this difficulty? 1 ask, also, whether
the blind and the lame had not previously served as soldiers
with David. But it is useless to insist longer on this argu·
ment, which the readers will discover from the sacred history
to be founded on mere falsehood 6. Thea follows another
allegory, that the apostles were “ fishers of men,’' (m) not of
infants. 1 ask, what is the meaning of that declaration of
Christ, that “the kingdom of heaven is like nuto a net, that
was cast into thesea, and gethered of every lrind? '³ (a) But
as Ι am not fond of allegorical trifliug, 1 answer, that when the
apostles were appointed to the office of teaching, they were not
forbidden to baptiae infanta 1 would further wish to be
informed, since the evangelist uses the word ανθρωπους, (a word
which comprehends all the human racc, without any exception,)
why infants should be denied to be culpentur, (human beings.)

perversiou of that passage of Paul, the subject of which relatos
to doctrine. When the Corinthians discovered too much com·
placency in avain subtlety, the apostle reproved their stupid-
ity, because they still required to be taught the first principles
of Christian doctrine. Who can infer from this, that baptism
ought to be denied to insants, whom, though they are born of .
the flesh, yet God consecratos to himself by gratuitous adoption?
