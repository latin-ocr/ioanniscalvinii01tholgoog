Βο1 10 stop here, would be failing iu the midst 01 001 000100;
101 10 keep the commandments is a task to which none of us
are equal. Being excluded, then, from the righteousness of tho
law, we are under the necessity of resorting to some other refuge,
namely, to saith in Christ. Wherefore, as the Lord, knowing

this doctor 01 1110 law to be inflated with 0 vain confidence in his
works, recalls his attention to the law, that it rnay teach him
his own character as a sinner, obnoxious to the tremendous
sentence of eternal death, so, in another place, addressing those
who have already been humbled under this knowledge, ho
omits all mention 01 the lav, and consoles thern with a promise
01 grace—“ Corne unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy
laden, and I will give you rest; and ye shall find rest unto
your souls.'' (c)

X. At length, after our adversaries have wearied themselves

= with perversioris of Scripture, they betake themselves to sub·

tleties and sophisms. 'l'hcy cavil, that saith is in some places
called a work, (d) and hence they infer that we. irnproperly

will, and not rather because, by embracing the Divine mercy, it
seals to our hearts the righteousness 01 Christ, which that mercy
offers to us in the preaching 01 1110 gospel. The reader will
pardon me for not dwelling on the confutation 01 00011 101110ος -
101 they require nothing to refute them but their own weakness.
But 1 wish briefly to answer one objection, which has some ap-
pearance 01 reason, to prevent 110 being the source 01 any dif-
ficulty to persons who have had but little experience. Since
common 00000 dictates that oppositcs are subject to similar
rules, and as all sins are imputed to us for unrighteousness,
they maintaiu it to be reasonable, on the other hand, that all
good works should be imputed to us 101 righteousness. 'Phose
who reply, that the condemnation 01 1000 proceeds from un·
belief alone, and not 11010 particular sins, do not satisfy me. I
agree with them, that incredulity is the sountain and root 01 011
evils. For it is the original defection from God, which is
afterwards followed by particular transgressions of the law.
, Βο1 as they appear to fix one and the same rule for good
and evil works in forming a judgment os righteousness or un·
righteousness, here 1 am obliged to dissent from them. For
the righteousness of works is the perfect obedieuce 01 1110 law.
We cannot therefore be righteous by works, unless we follow
this straight line throughout the whole 01 001 lives. The first
deviation from it is a lapse into unrighteousness. Hence it
appears that righteousness 011000 001 11010 000 01 0 few works,
