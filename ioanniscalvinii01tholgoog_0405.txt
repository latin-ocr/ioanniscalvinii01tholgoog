looses him whom it receives into its commuuion; because it
makes him, as it were, a partalrer of the unity which it has iu
Christ Jesus. That no man, therefore, may contemn the judg·
ment of the Church, or consider it as of little consequence that
he is condemned by the voice of believers, the Lord testifies
that such judgment of believers is no other than the promulga-
tion of his sentence, and that what they do on earth shall be

, ratified in heaven. For they have the word of God, by which

they condemn the perverse3 they have the same word, by
which they receive penitents into favour ; and they cannot err
or dissent from the judgment of God, because they· judge only
by the Divine law, which is not an uncertain or earthly opinion,
but the holy will and heavenly oracla of God. From these two
passages, which lthink Ι have familiarly and correctly, as well
as concisely‚ explained, these unreasonable men, without any
judgment, under the influeuce of misguided real, endeavour to
establish, sometimes auricular confession, sometimes excommu-
nication, sometimes jurisdiction, sometimes the right of legisla-

by the civil magistrate. Besides, the object of this power is, not
that he who has transgressed may be punisbed against his will
but that he may profess his repentance by avoluntary subruis·
sion to chastisement. The difference therefore is very great;
because the Church does not assume to itself what belongs
to the magistrate, nor can the magistrate executa that which
is executed by the Church. This will be better understood by
au example. Is any man intoxicated? ln a well regulated
city he will be punisbed by imprisonment. Has he committed
fornication ? He will receive the same or a severer punishment.
With this, the laws, the magistrate, and the civil judgmeut,
will all be satisfied3 though it may happen that he will give no
sign ofrepeutanco‚ bnt will rather murmur and rapine against his
tuuhment. Will the Church stop here? Such persons cannot
