them.''(p) But, that we may have a clear understanding of
the whole os this subject, let us proceed by the following steps:
That the universal Church is the whole multitude, collected
from all nations, who, though dispersed in countries widely
distant srorn each other, nevertheless consent to the same truth
os Divina doctrine, and are united by the bond os the same
religion; that in this universal Ohnrch are comprehended
particular churches, distributed according to human necessity
in various towns and villages; and that each of these respect·
ively is justly distinguished by the name and authority of a
church; and that individuale, who, on a profession os piety, are
enrolled among Ohurches of the same description, though they
are really strangers to any particular Church, do nevertheless in
some respect belong to it, till they are expelled from it by a
public decision. There is some difference, however, in the mode
os judging respecting private persons and churches. For it
may happen, in the case of persons whom we think altogether
unworthy of the society os the pious, that, on account of the
common consent os the Church, by which they are tolerated in
the body os Christ, we may be obliged to treet them as brethreu,
and to class them in the number of believers In our private opin-
ion we approve not os such persons as members of the Ohurch,
but we leave thern the station they hold among the people ol
God, till it be taken away from them by legitimate authority.
But respecting the congregation itself, we must sorm a different
judgment. Is they possess and honour the ministry os the word,
and the administration of the sacraments‚ they are, without
all doubt, entitled to be considered as a church; because it ia
certain that the word and sacramente cannot be unattended
with some good effects. ln this manner, we preserve the unity
os the universal Church, which diabolical spirits have always
been endeavouring to destroy3 and at the same time without
interfering with the authority of those legitimate assemblies,
which local convenience has distributed in different places.

X. We have stated that the marks by which the Church
is to be distinguished, are, the preaching os the word and the
administrationes the sacramenta. For these can nowhere exist
without bringing forth fruit, and being prospered with the
blessing os God. 1 assert not that wherever the word is
preached, the good effects os it immediately appear; but that it
is never received so as to obtain a permanent establishment,
without displaying some efficacy. However this may be,
where the word is heard with reverence, and the sacramente
are not neglected, there we discover, while that is the case, au
appearance os the Ohurch, which is liable to no suspicion or
