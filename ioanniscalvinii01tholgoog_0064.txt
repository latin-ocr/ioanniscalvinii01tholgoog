we believe heaven to be our country, it is better 101 us to
transmit our wealth thither, than to retain it here, where we
may lose it by a sudden removal. But how shall we transmit
it? Why, if we communicate to the necessities of ¹ the poor;
whatever is bestowed on thern, the Lord considers as given to
himself. (a) Whence that celebrated promise, “He that bath
pity upon the poor, lendeth unte the Lord.’¹ (0) Again: “ Ηο
which soweth bountifully shall reap also bountifully.'’ (p) For
all things that are bestowed on our brethren in away of
charity, are so many deposita in the band 01 the Lord; which
he, asa faithful depositary, will one day restore with ample
interest Are our acts 01 duty, then, it will be asked, so valu-
able in the sight 01 God, that they are like riches reserved
in his hand for us? And who can be afraid to assert this,
when the Scriptura so frequently and plainly declares it? But
if any one, from the mere goodness 01 God, would infer tha
merit 01 werke, these testimonias will afford no conntenance to
such an error. For we can infer nothing frorn thern except
the indulgence which God in his mercy is disposcd to show
us, since, in order to animate us to rectitude 01 conduct, though
the duties we perform are unworthy 01 the least notice from
him, yet he arrisere not one 01 them to go unrewarded

Vll. But they insist more 011 the words 01 the apostle, who,
to console the Thessalonians under their tribulations,tells them
that the design 01 their infliction is, “ that they may be count·
ed worthy 01 the kingdom of God, 101 which they also suffer.
Seeing,’' says he, “ it isa righteons thing with God to recom-

τι pense tribulation to them that trouble you, and to yon who are

troubled, rest with us, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed
from heaven.'' (q) And the author 01 the Epistle to the
Hebrews says, “ God is not urrrighteous to forget your work and
labour of love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that
ye have ministered to the saints.'' (r) To the first passage 1
reply, Γ11101 it indicates no werthiness of merit3 but since it
is the will 01 God the Father, that those whom he has chosen
as his children be conformed to Christ his first begottcu Son 3 (s)
as it was necessary 101 him first to suffer and then to enter
into the glory destined for him;(t) so “we must through
much tribulation enter into the kingdom of God,''(u) The
tribulatione, therefore, which we suffer for the name of Christ,
are, as it were, certain marks impressed on us by which God
usually distinguishes the sheep of his flock. For this reason,
then, we are accounted worthy of the kingdom 01 God, because
