Ι licentiousness in Christiane, to :ey that they were not under
the yoke os the lew, he discusses the nature of thet nbrogetien,
and shows what is the use of the law—n question which he
had already determined. The sum of all that he says is, that
we nre delivered from the rigonr of the law to edhere to
Christ,- und thet the office es the lnw ie to convince us of our
depruvity, and lead us to a confession os our impotence end
misery. Now, because the depruvity of oui· nature ie not eo
easily discovered in ι profane rnen who indulges his corrupt
passione without any sear of God, he gives nn extmplo iun
regenerato men, thet ie, in himself. He says, therefore, thet
he hes n perpetual conflict with the relies of hie corruption,
aud that he is bound with e misemhle servitude, which pre—
venis his entire een-secretim os himself to nn obediente of the
Divine lew, so thnt he is coristrained to exclnim, ‘¹0 wretched
men thet 1 ami Who shall deliver uie from the body of thie
death?'’ if the children of God are captives detained in
prison as long as they live, they cannot but feel great anxiety
from reflection on meir danger, unless there be something te

consolation, that “there is now no condar-nuntiari to them
which are in Christ Jesus;'’(p) by which he reaches, that

corporated into the communion of his Christ, und introduced
by baptism inro the society of his Chul-oh, notwithstanding
they ere sui-rounded end useulred with sin, end even carry ein
about within them, yet while they persevere iri the saith of
Christ, are ebeolved from guilt end condemnationi. Is this be
