assert, which it is not in their power to deny-that there is
scarcely one of the bishops, and notorie ina hundred of the
parochial clergy, who, if sentence were to be passed upon his
conduct according to the ancient canons, would not be excom·
municated‚ or, at the very least, deposed from his office. 'I'hat
ancient discipline, which required a more accurate investiga·
tion to bernado into the conductos the clergy, has so long
been obsoleta, that 1 may be considered as making an incredi-
ble assertion; bnt such is the fact. Now, let all, who fight
under the standards and auspices of the Roman see, go and
boast of their sacerdotal order. It is evident that the order
which they have is not derived from Christ, from his apostles,
from the fathers, or from the ancient Church.

XV. Now, let the dcacous come forward, with that most
sacred distribution which they have of the property of the
Church. They do not at present, however, create their deacons
for any such purpose; for they enjoin them nothing but to
sorve at the altar, to say or chant the gospel, and do l know
not what trifles. Nothing of the alms, nothingus the care of the
poor, nothing of the whole function which they executed in
primitive times. Ispealr of the institution itself. For if we
advert to the fact, it is now become no office at all, but only a
step towards the priesthood. In one circumstance, those who
act the part of a deacon at the mass, exhibit a useless and frivo-
lous resemblance of antiquity, in receiving the offerings before
the consecration. NoW, it was the ancient custom, that before
the communion of the supper, the faithful kissed each other,

⁰ and then offered their alms at the altar; thus they expressed

their charity, first by a sign, and then by active beneficence.
The deacon, who was steward for the poor, received what was
given, in order to distribute it. Of the alms given at present,
no more reaches the poor thanis they were thrown into the sea.
This false appearance of deaconship, therefore, is a mockcry of
the Charch. It contains nothing resembling the apostolic in-
stitution, or the ancient usage. Even the distribution of the
property they have turned into another channel; and have
ordered it in such a way, that it is impossible to imagine any
thing more disorderly. Foras robbers, after having murdered
some ill-fated travellers, divide the plunder among themselves,
so these men, aster having extinguished the light of God’s
word, and, as it were, cut the throat of the Charch, have con·
cluded that whatever had been dedicated to sacred uses, was
abandoned to plunder and rapine. They have therefore made a
divilsgon of it, and every one has seized as large a share as he
cou .

XVI. Herc, all the ancient usagcs which we have described,
have not only been disturbed, but entirely expunged and abo·
