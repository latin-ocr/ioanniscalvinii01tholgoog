IX. Now, what need is there to enumerate the repugnances
between councils aud councils, and how decrees passed by oue
have been rescinded by another? Here it must not be alleged,
that where there is such varianae between two councils, one
or the etheris not legitimate. For how shall we determine
this? 'l'he only way 1 know, is to ascertaiu from the
Scriptores that its decrees are not orthodox3 for there is no
other certain rule of decisiou. lt is now about nine hundred
years ago, that the Council of Constantinople‚ assembled under
the emperor leo, decreed that all images placed in churches
should be throwu down and broken in pieces. Soon after, the
Council of Nice, which the empress Irene convened in opposi-
tion to the former, decreed that they should be restored.
Which of these two shall we acknowledge as a legitimate
councill This character has generally been attributed to the
latter, which gave imagesa placeio the Ghurches. But Au·
gustine declares that this cannot be done without imminent

danger of idolatry. Epiphanius, a more ancient writer, ex-
presses himself in terms of much greater severity3 he says that
it is abominable wickedness for images to be seen iu the tem·
ples of Christians. Would the fathers who speak in this man·
ner approve of that council, if they were now living? But if

the accounts of historiens be true, and credit be given to the
acts themselves, that 'council not only admitted of images, but
determiued that they were to be worshipped. Now, itis evi-
dent that such a decree must have originated from Satan.
What shall we say to their perversions and mutilatione of the
Scripture, which demonstrate that they held it all in contempt,
as l have already proved? We shall never be ableto discrimi-
nate between the numerous councils, which dissentirem and
contradict each other, unless we examine them all by the word
of God, which is the universal standard for men and angele.
On this ground, we reject the second Genucil of Ephesus, and
receive the Council of Chalcedon, because the latter couucil
condemned the impiety of Eutyches, which the former had
sanctioned. 'Phia judgmeut of the Council of Chalcedon was
formed from the Scripturas by holy men, whom we imitate in
forming our judgmeut, as the word of God which enlightened
them continues to give light to us. Now, let the Romanists
go and boast, as they are accustomed todo, that the Holy
Spirit is inseparably attached to their councils.

X. Even in the earliest aud purest councils, however, there is
something to complain of —either that the bishops who com·
