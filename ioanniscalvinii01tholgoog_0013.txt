antecedent to a reconciliation to God by faith, are accursed,
and uot only of uo avail to justification, but certainly deserving
of condemnation. But why do wedisputeconcerning itas a
dubious point, when it is already proved by the testimony of the
apostle, that “without faith it is impossible to please God ἓ ” (d )

V. But the proof will be still clearer, if the grace of God be
directly opposed to the natural condition of man. 'Phe Scrip-
ture invariably proclaims, that God finds nothing in men which
can incita him to bless them, but that he prevents them by his
gratuitous gooduess. For what can a dead man do to recover
life? But when God illuminatas us with the knowledge of
himself, he is said to raise us from death, and to make us new
creatures.(e) For under this character we find the Divine
goodness towards us frequently celebrated, especially by the
apostlc. “God‚” says he, “ 'who is rich in mercy, for his great
love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in sins,
bath quickcned us together with Christ,” &c (s) In another
place, when, under the type of Abrabam, he treats of the general
calling of believers, he says, It is “ God‚ who quickcneth the
dead, and calleth those things which be not as though they
were.’' (g) If we are nothing, what can we dol Wherefore
God forcibly represses this presumptiou, in the Book of Job, in
the following words: “ Who heth prevented me, that 1 should
repay him? Whatsoever is under the whole heaven is
mirre.''(b) Paul,'explaining this passage, concludes from it,
that we ought not to suppose we bring any thing to the Lord
but ignominious indigenae and emptiness. (i) Wherefore, in
the passage cited above, in order to prove that we attain to the
hope of salvation, not by works, but solely by the grace of God,
be alleges, that “we are bis workmanship, created in Christ
Jesus unto good works, which God bath before ordained that
we should welk in them.”(lr) As though he would say, Who
of us ¹can boast that he has influenced God by his right-
eousness, since our first power to do well proceeds from re·
generationi For, according to the constitution of our nature,
oil might be extracted from a stone sooner than we could
perform· a good work. 1t is wonderful, indeed, that man,
condemned to such ignominy, dares to pretend to have any
thing left. Let us confess, therefore, with that eminent servant
of the Lord, that “God bath saved us, and called us with a
holy calling, not according to our works, but according to his
