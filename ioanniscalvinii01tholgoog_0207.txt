lieving in him, may “ rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of
glory,'’ till we receive “the end of our faith.” (q) For which
reason, Paul represents the saith and hope of believers es having
respect to “the hope that is laid up in heaven.” (r) When we
are thus looking towards heaven, with our eyes fixed upon
Ohrist, and nothing detains them on earth honr carrying us
forward to the promised blessedness, we realize the fulfilment
of that declaration, “Where your treasure is, there will your
heart be also.'’ (a) Hence it is, that faith is so scarce in the
world; because to our sluggishness nothing is more difficult
than to ascend through innumerable obstacles, “ pressing to-
ward the mark, for the prize of the high calling.'' (t) To the
accumulation of miserias which generally oppress us, are added
the mockeriee of the profane, with which our simplicity is as-
sailed ; while voluntarily renouncing the allurements of present

. advantage or pleasure, we seem to pursue happiness, which is

“ conceeled from our view, like ashadow that eoudnually eludes
our grasp. ln a word, above and below, before and behind, we
are beset by violent temptatione, which our minda would long
ago have been incapable of sustaining, if they had not been
detached from terrestrial things, and attached to the heaven·
ly life, which is apparently at a remote distance. He alone,
therefore, has made a solid proficicucy in the gospel who has
been accustomed to continual meditation ou the blessed resur·
rection.

11. The supreme good was a subject of anxious disputa, and
even contentiori, among the ancient philosophers; yet none of
them, except Plato, ackuowledged the chief good of man to
consist in his union with God. But of the nature of thie
union he had not even the smallest idea; end no wonder, for
he was totally uninformed respecting the sacred bond of it.
We know what is the only and perfect happiness even in this
earthly pilgrimage; but it daily inflames our hearts with in·
creasing desires after it, till we shall be satisfied with its full
fruition. Therefore l have observed that the advantage of
Christ’s benefits is solely enjoyed by those who elevate their
minds to the resurrection. Thus Paul also sets before believers
this object, towards which he tells us he directs all his own
efforts, forgetting every thing else, “ if by any means he may
attain unto it.’' (a) And it behoves us to prese forward to the
same point with ‘the greater alacrity, lest, if this world engross
our attention, we should be grievously punished for our sloth.
He therefore characterizes believers by this mark, “Our con-
versation is in heaven, from whence also we look for the Sa·
viour.’' (a) And that their minds may not flag in this coruse,
