this that he is divinely appointed, in order that we may be de·
fended by his power and protection against the malice and
injuries of wiclred rnen, and may lead peaceable and secure
lives. But if it be in vain that hc is given to us by the Lord
for our protection, unless it be lawful for us to avail ourselves
of such au advantage, it clearly follows that we may appcal to
him, and apply for his aid, without any violation os piety.
But here l have 10 110 with two sorts 01 persons3 forthere are
multitudes inflamed with such a rage for litigation, that they
never have peace in themselves, unless they are in contentiou
with others, and they commence their lawsuits with a mortal
bitterness of animosities, and with an infuriated cupidity of
revenge and injury, and pursue them with an implacable ob-
stinacy, even to the ruin of their adversary, At the same time,
that they may not be thought todo any thing wrong, they
defend this perverseness under the pretext 01 secking justice.
But, though it is allowable for a man 1ο endeavour 10 obtain
justice from his neighbour by a judicial process, hc is not
therefore at liberty 1ο hate him, or to cherish a desire 10 hurt
him, or to persecute him without mercy.

XVlll. Let such persons, therefore, understand, that judicial
praeesses arelawful 1ο those who use them rightly, and that
the right use, both for the plaintiff and for the defendant, is this:
First, if the plaintiff, being injured either in his person or in his
property, has recourse to the protection 01 the magistrate, states
his complaint, makes a just and equitable claim, but without
any desire of injury or revenge, without any asperity or hatred,
without any ardour for contentiori, but rather prepared to waive
his right, and 10 sustain some disadvantage, than to cherish
eumity against his adversary, Secondly, if the defendant,
being summoned, appears on the day appointed, aud defends his
cause hythe best arguments in his power, without any bitter-
ness, but with the simple desire of maintaining his just right.
On the contrary, when their minds are filled with malevolence,
corrupted with envy, incensed with wrath, stimulated with
revenge, or inflamati with the fervour of contentiori, so as to
dimiuish their charity, all the proceedings 01 1110 justest cause
are inevitably wiched. For it ought to be an established
maxim with all Christians, that however just a cause may be,
uo lawsuit can ever be carried on in a proper manner by any
man, who does not feel as much benevolence and affection
towards his adversary, as 11 the business in dispute had already⁴
been settled and terminated by an amicable adjustment. Some, ¹
perhaps, will object, that such moderatiori in lawsuits is far
110111 being ever practised, and that if one instance of it were
to be found, it would be regarded as a prodigy. 1 confess,

indeed, that, in the corruption of these times, the example οἳ
