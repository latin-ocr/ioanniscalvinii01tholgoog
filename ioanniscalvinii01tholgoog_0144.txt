and being made man, was given to men as the Angel of great
connsel. (c) And this prayer is so comprehensive and com·
plete, that whatever addition is made of any thing extraneous
³ or foreign, not capable of being referred to it, is impious aad

unworthy of the approbation of God. For in this summary he
has prescribed what is worthy of him, what is acceptable to
him, what is necessary for us, and, in a word, what he chooses
to bestow. Wherefore those who presume to go beyond it,
and to ask of God any thing else, in the first place, are deter-
mined to make some addition of their own to the wisdom of
God, which canum be done without folly and blasphemy; in
the next place, despising the limits fixed hythe will of God,
they are led far astray by their own irregular desitas, and in
the last place, they will never obtain any thing, since they
pray without faith. And there is no doubt that all prayers of
this kind are made without saith, because they are not sane·
tioned by the word of God, the only basis on which saith cau
stand. But they who neglect the Master’s rule, and indulge
their own desires, not only deviare from the word of God, bnt
make all possible opposition against it. With equal beauty and ¹
truth, therefore, Tertullian has called this a kgiwwtote prayer,
tacitly implying‚ that all others are irregular and unlawful.

XLIX. We would not here be understood, as if we were
⁴confined to this form of prayer, without the liberty of changing
a word or syllable. For the Scripturas contaiu many prayers,
expressed in words very different from this, yet written by the
same Spirit, and very penante for our use. Many, which
have little verbal resemblance to it, aro continually suggested
to believere by the sarno Spirit We only mean by these ob·
servations, that uo one should eren seelr, expect, or ask for any
thing thetis net summarily comprehended in this prayer,
though there may be a diremiw of expression, without any -
variationes sense. As it is certain that all the prayers con·
tained in the Scripturas, or proceeding from picus hearne, are
referred to this, so it is impossible to find oue any where which -
can sur-pass or even equal the perfectiori of this. Here is
nothing omitted which ought to be recollected for the praises
of God, nothing that should occur to the mind ot' man for his own
advantage; aud the whole is so complete, aa justly to inspire
universal despair of attempting any improvement. 'l'o con·
clude; let us remember, that this is the teaching of Divine
wisdom, which taught what it willed, and willed what is
needfnl.
