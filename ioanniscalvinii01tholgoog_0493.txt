XI. The other thing to be remarked is, that this depravity
never ceases in us, but is perpetually producing new fruita-
those works of the flesh which we have already described, like
the emission of flame and sparks from a heated furnace, or like
the streams of water from an unfailing spring. For concupis·
cence never dies, nor is altogether extinguished in men, till by
death they are delivered from the body of death, and entirely
divested of themselves. Baptism, indeed, promises us the sub·
mersion of our Pharaoh, and the mortification of sin; yet not
so thbt it no longer existe, or gives us no further trouble, but
only that it may never overcome us. For as long as we

· live immured in this prison of the body, the relics of sin will

dwell in us, but if we hold fast by saith the promise which
God has given us in baptism, they shall not domineer or reign
overas. But let no one deceive himself, let no one fiatter
himself in his guilt, when he hears that sin always dwells in us.
These things are not said in order that those who are already
too prone to do evil may securely sleep in their sins, but only
that those who are tempted byt eir corrupt propensities may
not faint and sink into despondency3 but that they may
rather reflect that they are yet in the way, and may consider
themselves as having made some progress, when they ex·
perience their corruptions diminishing from day to day, till
they shall attain the mark at which they are aiming, even the
final destruction of their depravity‚ which will be accomplished
at the close of this mortal life. ln the mean time, let them not
cease to fight manfully, to animate themselves to constant ad-
vances, and to prese forward to complete victory. For it ought
to give additional impulse to their exertions, to see that, after
they have been striving so long, so much still remains for them
to do. We conclude, therefore, that we are baptized into the
mortification of the flesh, which commences in us at baptism,
which we pursue from day to day, and which will be perfected
when we shall pass out of this life to the Lord.

XII. Here we say nothing different from what is most
clearly stated by Paul in the sixth and seventh chapters of the
Epistle to the Romans. For after he had argued respecting gra-
tuitous righteousness, —because some impious men concluded
from that doctrine that they might live according to their own
corrupt inclinations, as we are not accepted by God for the
merit of our works, he adds, that all who are clothed with the
righteousness of Christ are also regenerated by his Spirit, aud
that of this regeneration we have an earnest in baptism.
Hence he exhorts believers not to suffer sin to reign in their
members. Because he knew that there always remains some
infirmity in them, that they might not be dejected on account
of it, he adds for their consolation, that they are not under
