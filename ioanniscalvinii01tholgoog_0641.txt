itself is part of the sacrament, and that it represents the union

which we have with Christ in conformity of nature3 because
it is by that intercourse that a husband and wife beccam one
tlesh. Here some of them have found two sacraments; one,
of God and the soul, in the man and woman when betrothed;
the other, of Christ and the Church, in the husband and wife.
The conjugal intercourse, upon their principles, however, is a
sacrament, from which no Christian ought to be prohibited;
unless the sacraments os Christiana are so incompatible, that
they cannot consist together. There is also another absurdity
in their doctrine. They affirm that the grace of the Holy
Spirit is conferred in every sacrament 3 they acknowledge that
the conjugal intercourse is a sacrament3 yet they deny that
the Holy Spirit is ever present in that intercourse.

XXXVII. And, not to deceive the Church in one thing
only, what a long series of errors, falsehoods, frauda, aud iui-
quities, have they joined to that false principle! lt may truly
be affirmed that, when they made matrimony into a sacrament,
they only sought a den of all abominations. For, when they
had once established this notiori, they assumed to themselves
the cognizanee os matrimonial causes; for matrimony was a
spiritual thing, and not to be meddled with before lay judges.
Their they made laws for the confirmation of their tyranny3
aud some of thern manifestly impious towards God, and others
most unjust towards men. Such as, that marriages contracted
between young persons subject to the authority of parents,
without the consent of their parents, remain valid and perma-
nent; that no marriages be lawful between persons related,
even to the seveuth degree, and that, if any such be con·
tracted, they be dissolved, (aud the degrees themselves they
state in opposition to the laws of all nations, and to the institu-
tion of Moses, so that what they call the fourth degree is, in
reality, the seveuth 3) that it be unlawsul for a man, who has
repudiated his wife for adultery‚ to marry another; that spiritual
relatives be not united in marriage 3 that no marriages be cele-
brated frorn Septuagesima, or the third Sunday before Lent,
to the octaves of Easter, or eight days after that festival ; for
three weeks before the natifity of John the Baptist, or Mid-
summerday, instead of which three weelrs they now substitute
the Whitsun weelr, and the two weelrs which precede it; or
from Advent to the Epiphany; and innumerable other regula·
tions, which it would be tedicus to enumerate. We must now
quit their corruptions, in which we have been detained longer
than 1 could wish: but I think 1 have gained some advantage
by stripping these asses, in some measure, of the lion's skiu,

and so far unmaslring their principles, aud exposing them to
Ἦ in their true colours..
