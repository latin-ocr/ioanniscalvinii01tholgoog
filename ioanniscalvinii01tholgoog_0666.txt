be their characters, they have their govemment only from him ;
that those who govem for the public good are true specimeus
and mirrors os his beneficence3 and that those who rule in an
unjust and tyrannical manner are raised up by him to punish
the iniquity os the people; that all equally possess that sacred
majesty with which he has invested legitimare authority. 1
will not proceed any further till l have subjoined afew testi·
menies in proof ol this point. lt is unnecessary, however, to
labour much to evince au impious king to be a judgment os
God’s wrath upon the world, as I have no expectatiou that any
one will deny it: and in this we say no more of aking than
of any other robber who plunders our property, or adulterer
who violates our bed; or assassin who attempts to murder us;
since the Scriptura enumerates all these calamities among the
curses indicted by God. But let us rather insist on the proos
of that which the minds of men do not so easily admit; that
a mau os the worst character, and most undeserving of all
honour, who holds the sovereign power, really possessas that
eminent and Divine authority, which the Lord has given by
his word to the ministers of his justice and judgment3 and,
therefore, that he ought to be regarded by his subjects, as far
as pertains to public obedience, with the same reverence and
esteem which they would show to the best os kings, if such a
one were granted to thern.

XXVI. Iu the first place, Ι request my readers to observa
and consider with attention, what is so frequently and justly
mentioned in the Scriptures,—the providence and peculiar
dispensation of God in distributing kingdoms and appoint-
ing whom he pleases to be kings. Daniel says, “ God changeth
the times and the seasons: he removeth kings and setteth up
kings.”(q) Again: “That the living may know that the
Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
whomsoever he will.’' (r) Passages os this kind abound
throughout the Scripturas, but particularly in this prophecy.
Now, the characteres Nabuchadnezzar, who conquered Jerusa-
lem, is sufficiently known, that he was an invader and depopu-
latores the territorias of others. Yet by the mouth os Ezekiel
the Lord declares that he had given him the land os Egypt, as
a reward sor the service which he had performed indevastatiug
'Pyre (s) And Daniel said to him, “ Thou, Ο king, arta king
of kings; for the God ol heaven hath given thee a kingdom,
power, and strength, and glory; and wheresoever the children
of men dwell, the beasts os the field, and the fowls of the
heaven, hath he given into thine hand, and hath made thee
ruler over all.'’ (t) Again: to his grandson Belshazzar Daniel
