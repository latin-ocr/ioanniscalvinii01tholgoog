by the liberality os another, enjoys the uso and profit of aa
estate, usurp to himself also the title of propriotor, does ho
not by such ingratitudo deservo tolose the possession which ho
had? So also if a slave, manumitted by his master, conceal
his mean condition as a freed-man, arrd boast that he tvas free
by birth, does he not deservo to be reduced to his former
servitude? For this is the legitimato way os enjoying a benefit,
if we neither arrogate more than is given us, nor defraud our
benefactor of his due praiso3 but, on the contrary, conduct
ourselves in such a manner, that what he has conferred on us
may appear, as it were, to continue with himself. lf this
moderation ought to be observed towards men, let every one
examine and consider what is dne to God.

iv. lknow that the sophista abusa some texts in order to
prove that tho term metit is found in the Scripturas with refer·
ence to God. They cite a passage from Ecclesiasticus: “ Mercy
shall make placo sor every man according to the merit of his
works.” (p) And from the Epistle to the Hebrews: “Το do
good, and to communicate, forget not; sor with such sacrificos
men merit of God.'’ (q) My right to reject the authority of
Ecclesiasticus 1 at present relinquish3 but I deny that they
faithfully cite the words of the writer os Ecclesiasticus, who-
everha might be; for iu the Greek copy it is as follows:
Hecu ελεημοσυνη «ernon resorbentes yap xasa aa tpya aaron stipatu.
“ He shall maire place for every mercy; and every man shall
find according to his works.” And that this is the genuino
reading, which is corrupted in the Latin version, appears both
from the complexion of the words themselves aud from tho
preceding context. ln the passage quoted from the Epistle to
the Hebrews, there is no reason why they should endeavour to
insnare us by a single word, when the apostle’s words in tho
Greek imply nothing moro than that “with such sacrifices God
is well pleased.'' This alone ought to bo abundantly sufficient
to repress and subdue the insolence of our pride, that we trans-
gress not tho scriptural rnle by ascribing any dignity to human
works. Moreovor, tho doctrino of the Scriptura is, that our
good works are perpetually defiled with many blemishes, which
might justly offend God and incense him against us ; so far are
they from being able to conciliato his favour, or to excito his
beneficence towards us3 yet that, because in his great mercy
he does not examine them according to tho rigour of his justice,
he accepts them as though they were immaculately pure, and
therefore rewards them, though void of all merit, with infinito
blessings both in this life and in that which is to come. For 1
munet admit the distinction laid down by some, who are other·
