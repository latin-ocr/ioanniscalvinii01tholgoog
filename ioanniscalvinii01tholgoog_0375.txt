aman to suppress what he knows within himself, but pursues
him till it brings him to a sense of his guilt. This is what
Paul means, when he speaks of men's “conscience also bear-
ing witness, and their thoughts the mean while accusing, or
else excusing, one another ” (ὅ) before God. A simple know·
ledge might remain in man, as it were, in a state of conceal·
ment. Therefore this sentiment, which places men before the
tribunal of God, is like a keeper appointed over man to watch
and observe all his secrets, that nothing may remain buried in
darkness. Hence that old proverb, that conscience is equal to
athousand witnesscs. For the same reason, Peter speaks of
“the answer of a good conscience towards God,'' (lc) to denote
our tranquillity of mind, when, persuaded of the grace of Christ,

or absolved, so as to feel no more remorso or compunction
for sin.

IV. Therefore, as works have respect to man, so the con·
sciense is referred to God. A good conscience is no other
than an internal purity of beart. In this sense Paul says thet
“ the end of the commandment is charity, out of a pure beart,
and of a good conscience, and of faith unfeigned.'' (m) ln a
subsequent part of the same chapter, he shows how widely it
differs from simple knowledge, when he says, that “some
having put away a good conscience, concerning faith have
made shipwreck.'' (n) For in these words he implies that it
is a lively zeal for the worship of God, and a sincere desire
and endeavour to live a pious and holy life. Sometimes, in·
deed, it is likewise extended to men, as when Luke states Paul
to have made this declaration—“I exorciso myself, to have
always a conscience void of offence toward God and toward
men.'' (o) The apostle expressed himself in this manner, be-
cause the benefits proceeding from a good conscience do resch
even to man. But strictly speaking, the consciencebes respect
to God alone,‘as 1 have already observed. Hence it is, that a
law is said to hind the conscience, which simply binds a man
without any observation or consideration of other men. For
example, God not only commanda the heart to be preserved
chaste and pure from every libidinous desire, but prohibits all
obscenity of language and external lasciviousness. My con-
science is bound to observe this law, even though not another
man existed in the world. The person, therefore, who corn·
mits any breach of chastity, not only siris by setting a bad ex·
