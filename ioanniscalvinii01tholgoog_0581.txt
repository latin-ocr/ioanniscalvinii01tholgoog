mise is given to those who observo the commmdment con-
nected with it, but that they are entirely unsupported by the
word of God, who transfer the sacrament to any other usage.
We have already shown how the mystery of the supper pro-
motes our saith before God. But as God here not only recalls
to our remembrance the vast exuberance of his goodness, but de-
livers it, as it were, into our hands, as we have already declared,
and excites us to ackuowledge it, so he also admonishes us
not to be ungrateful for such a profusion of beneficeuce, but,
on the contrary, to maguify it with the praises it deserves,
aud to celebrate it with thaultsgivings. Therefore, when he
gave the institution of this sacrament to the apostles, he said
to them, “This do in remembrance of me ; ” (i) which Paul
explains to be “showing the Lord’s death ς ” (k) that is, pub·
licly, and all together, as with oue mouth, to confess that all
our confidence of life aud salvation rests on the death of
the Lord; that we may glorify him by our confession, and by
our example may exhort others to give him the same glory.
Here, again, we see the object to which the sacrament tenda,
which is, to exercise us iu a remembrauce of the death of
Christ. For the command which we have received, to “show
the Lord’s death till he corne '' to judgment, is no other than
to declare, by the confession of our lips, what our faith bas
achnowledged in the sacrament, that the death of Christ is our
life. This is the second use of the sacrament, which relates
to external confession.

XXXVIII. In the third place, the Lord intended it to serve
us as an exhortatiou, aud uo other could be better adapted to
animate and influence us in the most powerful manner to purity
and sanctity of life, as well as to charity, peace, and concord
For there the Lord communicates his body to us in such a
manner that he becomes completely one with ns, and we
become oue with him. Now, as he has only one body, of
which he makes ns all partakers, it follows, of necessity, that,
by such participation, we also are all made one body; and
this uniou is represented by the breed which is exhibited iu
the sacrament. For as it is composed of many grains, mixed
together iu such a manner that one cannot be separated or dis-
tinguished from another, - in the same manner we ought, lilre·
wiso, to be connected and united together, by such au agree·
ment of minds, as to admit of no disseusiou or division be·
tween us. This Ι prefer expressing iu the language of Paul:
“ The cupos blessiug which we blesa, is it not the communion
of the blood of Christ? 'Phe breed which we break, is it not
the communion of the body of Christ? For we, being many,
