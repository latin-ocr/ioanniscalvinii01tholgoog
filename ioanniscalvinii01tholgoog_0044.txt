own intrinsie goodness, but by reason of the eovenant, because
the Lord in his merey has estimated them so highly. But at
the same time, they had not observed how far the works,
which they styled mer-iterious, fell short of the condition of the
promise, unless they were preceded by justification founded
on saith alone, and by remissiori of sins, by which even good
works require to be purified from blemishes. Therefore, of the
three causes of the Divine goodness, in consequence of which
the works of believers are accepted, they only noticed one,
and suppressed two others, and those the principal.

IV. They allege the declaration of Peter, which Luke recites
in the Acts: ‘⁶ Of a trutlr l perceive that God is no respectet of
persons; but in every nation he that worketh righteousness is
accepted with him” (lc) And hence they conclude, what
they think admits of no doubt, that if a man by rectitude of
conduct conciliate to himself the favour of God, the grace of
God is not the sole cause of his salvation3 moreover, that God
of his own merey assists a sinner in such a manner, as to be
influenced to the exercise of merey by his werke. But we
cannot by any means reconcile the Scriptores with themselves,
unless we observe a twofold acceptanee of man with God.
For God finds nothing in man, in his native condition, to
incline him to merey, but mere misery. If, then, it is evident
that man is entirely destitute of all good, and full of every kind
of evil, when he is first received by God, by what good qualities
shall we pronounce hirn entitled to the heavenly calling? let
us reject, therefore, all vain imagination of merite, where God
so evidently displays hisumnerited clemency. The declaration
of the angel to Cornelius in the same passage, “Thy prayers
and thine alms are corne up for a memorial before God,''
they most wickedly pervert to prove that the practice of good
works preparcs a man to receive the grace of God. For
Cornelius must have been already illuminated with the Spirit
of wisdom, since he was endued with the sear of God, which
is true wisdom; and he must have been sanctified by the same
Spirit, since he was a follower of righteousness, which the
apostle represents as one of the Spirit’s most certain fruits. (l)
It was from the grace of God, then, that he derived all these
things in which he is said to have pleased hinr3 so far was he
from preparing himself to receive it by the exercise of his own
powers There cannot indeed be adducedasingle syllable of the
scripture, whichisnot in harmony withthis doctrine, That there
is no other cause for God's reception of man into his love, than
bis knowledge thet man, if abandoned by him, would be utterly
lost; and because it is nothis will to abendon him to perdition,
