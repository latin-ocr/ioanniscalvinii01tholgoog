truth —that death is due to the demerita of men, and that life
proceeds solely from the marey of God. Lastly, these phrases
denote rather tha order of the Diviue gista, than the cause of
them. lu the accumulatiou of graces upon greces, God derives
from the former a reason sor adding the next, that he may not
omit any thing necessary to the enriehment of his servants.
And while he thus pnrsues his liberality, he would have ns
always to remember his gratuitous election, which is the
source and original of all. For although he loves the gifts
which he daily confers, as emanations from that fountain‚ yet
it is our duty to adhere to that gratuitons acceptanee, which
alone can support our sonls, and to connect the gifts of his
Spirit, which he afterwards bestows on us, with the first cause,
in such a manner as will uot be derogatory to it.

We have now discussed the principal branch of this subject,
that because righteousness, if dependent on werla, must inevi-
tably be confounded in the sight of God, therefore it is con·
tained exclusively in the rnercy of God and the participation
of Christ, and consequently iu saith alone. Now, it must be
carefully remarked that this is the principal hinge ou which the
argument turns, that we may not be implicated in the common
delusion, which equally affecta the learned and the vulgar.
For as soon as justification by faith or works becomes the sub· ’
ject of inquiry, they have immediate recourse to those passages
which seem to attribute to works some degree of merit in the
sight of G0d; as though justification by works would be fully
evinced, if they could be proved to be of any value before
God. We have already clearly demonstrated that the right·
eonsuess of works consists only iu a perfect and complete ob·
servance of the law. Whence it follows, that noman is justified
by works, but he who, being elevated to the summit of perfec-
tion, cannot be convicted even of the least transgression. This,
therefore, isa different and separate question, whether, although
works be utterly insufficient for the justificationes men, they
do not, nevertheless, merit the grace of God.
