it were not distinguished by wealth and lofty titles. lt we
consult the authority of Christ on this subject, there is no doubt
that he intended to exclude the ministers of his word from civil
dominion and secular sovereignty, when he said, “The kings
of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them; but it shall not
be so among you.’' (w) For by these words he signifies, not
only that the office ot' a pastor is distinct from the office of a
prince, but that they are so different, that they can never be
properly united in one man. For though Moses held both these
offices at once, it may be observed, first, that this was the result
of a special miracle3 secondly, that it was only a temporary
arrangement, till things should be better regulated. But, as
soon as God prescribed a certain formos government, Moses
was lest in possession os the civil administration, and was com·
manded to resign the priesthood to his brother; and that for a
very sufficient reason; sor it is beyond the ability of nature
sor one man to be capable ot' sustaining the burden os both.
And this has been caresully observed in the Church in all ages
For as long as any real appearance os a Ghurch remained, not
one os the bishops ever thought ot' usurping the power of the
sword; so that it was a common proverb in the time of Ambrose,
“ That emperors rather covered the priesthood, than priests the
empire;’' sor as he afterwards observes, it was the firm and
universal opinion, “That palaces belonged to emperors, and
churches to priests.”

IX. But since a method has been contrived for bishops to
retain the title, honour, and emoluments os their office without
any burden or solicitude, that they might not be left entirely
without occupation, the power os the sword has been given to
them, or rather they have usurped it to themselves. With what

’ plea will they defend such impudence? Was it sor bishops
to perplex themselves with judicial proceedings, to assume the
government os cities and provinces, and to undertake various
other occupatione so incompatible with their office, which alone
would furnish thern so much labour and employment, that even
if they were entirely and assiduously devoted to it, without the
least distraction of other avocatione, they would scarcely be
able to discharge its functione? But they have the hardihood
to boast,that this causes the Church ol Christ to flourish with a

glory suitable to its dignity, and at the sarne time that they
are not too much distracted from the duties os their vocation.
With respect to the first point, if it be a becoming ornament
ot‘ the sacred office, for those who sustain it to be elevated to a
degree ot' power formidable to the greatest monarche, they have
reason to expostulate with Christ, by whom their honour has
been so grievously wounded. For in their opinion, at least,
