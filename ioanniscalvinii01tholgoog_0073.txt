small, rude, and imperfect, will be approved by our most indul·
gent Father. This he also confirma te us by the prophet: “l
will spere them,” saith he, “aa aman spareth his own son that
serveth him 3 ’' (lc) where it is evident, from the mention of
service, that the werd spere is used ιο denote indulgence, or an
overlooking of faults. And we have great need ef this confi·
dence, without which all eur endeavours will be vain ; fer
God considers us as sarving him in none of eur werke, but
such as are truly done by us to his honour. But how can
thisbe dene amidst these terrers, where it is a matter ef doubt
whether our werke offend God or honour him?

Vl. This is the reason why the author ef the Epistle ιο the
Hebrews refers to saith, and estimates only by faith, all tha
good werke which are recorded of the hely patriarcha. (l) On
this liberty there is a remarkable passage in the Epistle te tha
Romans, where Paul reasons that sin ought net to have do·
minieu over us, because we are not under the law, but under
grace. (m) For after he had exhorted believers, “Lat not
sin, therefore, reign in your mertal body3 neither yield ye
your members as instrumente of unrighteeusness5 but yield
yourselves unto God, as these that are alive from the dead,
and your members as instrumente of righteousness unte
God,” (rt) —they might, on the contrary, object that they yet
carried about with them the flesh full of inordinate desires, and
that sin dwelt iu them; but he adds the consolation furnished
by their liberty from the law; as though he had said, Al·
though you de net yet experience sin to be destroyed, and
righteousness living in you in perfectiori, yet you have ne
causa fer terror and dejection ef mind, as if God were perpetu·
ally offended on account ef your remaining sin; because by
grace you are emancipated from the law, that your werks may
net be judged according to that rule. But those, who infer
that we may commit sin because we are not under the law,
may be assured that they have no concern with this liberty,
the end of which is te animate us to virtue.

Vll. The third part of Christian liberty teaches us, that we
are bound by no obligation before God respecting externsl
things, which in themselves are indifferent; but that we may
indifferently sometimes use, and at other times emit them.
And the knowledge of this liberty also is very necessary for

' us; for without it we shall have ne tranquillity ef conscience,

ner will there be any end ef superstitione. Many in the pre·
sent age think it a felly to raise any disputa concerning the
free usa ef meets, of days, and ef habits, aud similar subjecta,
considering these things as frivolous and nugatory; but they
