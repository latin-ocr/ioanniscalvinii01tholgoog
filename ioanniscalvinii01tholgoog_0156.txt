people is not always effectual and permanent, a reason readily
presents itself, because, when God covenants with them, he does
· not also give them the spirit of regeneration to enable them to
persovere in the covenant to the end; but the external call,
without the internal efficacy of grace, which would be suffi-
cient for their preservation, is a kind of medium between the
rejection of all mankind and the election of the small number
of believers. The whole nation of Israel was called “God's
inheritance,'' though many of them were strangers; but God,
having firmly covenanted to be their Father and Redeemer,
regards that gratuitous favour rather than the defection of mul-
titudes; by whom his truth was not violated, because his pre·
servation of acertain remnant to himself, made it evident that his
calling was without repentance. For God’s collection of a
Ohurch for himself, from time to time, from the children of
Abraham, rather than from the profane natione, was in con·
sideration of his covenant, which, being violated hythe multi-
tude, he restricted to a few, to prevent its total failure. Lastly,
the general adoption of the seed of Abraham was a visible re·
presentation of a greater blessing, which God conferred ona
few out of the multitude. This is the reason that Paul so
carefully distinguishes the descendants of Abraham according
, to the flesh, from his spiritual children called after the example
of Isaac. Not that the mere descent from Abraham wasa vain
and unprofitable thing, which could not be asserted without
depreciating the covenant3 but because to the latter alone the
immutabis counsel of God, in which he predestinated whom
he would, was of itself effectual to salvation. But l advisa my
readers to adopt no prejudioe on either side, till it shall appear
from adduced passages of Scriptura what sentimenta ought to
be entertained, lu conformity, therefore, to the clear doctrina
of the Scriptura, we essert, that hyan eternal and immutable
oounsel, God has once for ul determined, both whom be would
admitto salvation, and whom he would condemn to destruc·
tion' We affirm that this oounsel, as far as concerns the elect,
is founded on his gratuitous mercy, totally irrespective of
human merit; but that to those whom he devotes to condem-
nation, the gato of life is closed by a just and irreprehensible,
but incomprehensible, judgment. ln the elect, we consider
calling as an evidence of electiori, and justification as another
token of its manifestation, till they arrive in glory, which con·
stitntes its completion. As God seals his elect by vocation
and justification, so by excluding the reprobate from the know·
ledge of his name and the mactification of his Spirit, he affords
an indication os the judgment that awaits tham. Here ’shall
pass ovar ιω] fictione fabricated by foolish mento overthrow

predestination, It is unnecessary to rehrte things vm]
