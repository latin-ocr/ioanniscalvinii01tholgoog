we should wuit iu indoleat supineuess till he call our minda from
other engagements aad draw theru to himself ; but rather that,
wearied without sloth and inactivity, we may implore such as-
sistance of the Spirit. Nor does the apostle, when he exhorta
us to ‘⁴ pray in the Holy Ghost,'' (lc) encourage us to remit our
vigilance3 siguifyiug, that the inspiratiou of the Spirit operatas
in the formation of our prayers, so aa not in the least to irnpede
or retard our own exertious3 since it is tha will os God to
prove in this instance the efficacious influence os saith on our
hearts.

Vl. let this be the second rulc: 'I'hat in our supplicatione
we should have a real and permanent sensa of our indigenae,
and seriously considering our necessity of all that wa ask,
should joiu with the petitione themselves a senous and ardent
desire os obtaining thern. For multitudes careleusly recita a
form of prayer, as though they were dischargiuga taslr imposed
ou them by God, and though they consess that this isa
remedy necessary for their calamities, since it would be certain
dsstmction to be destitute of the Divina aid which they im-

this hypocrisy, when any man prays for the pardon of sins,
who at the same time thinlrs he is not a sinuer, or at least does
not think that he is a sinuerl which isan open moelrery os
God himself. But such depravity, as 1 have before observed,
pervadas the whole human race, that as a matter of form they
frequently implore of God many things which they either ex-
pect to receive from some other source independent of his good·
uess, or imagine themselves already to possess. 'Phe crime of
some others appears to be smeller, but yet too great to be
tolerated3 who, having only imbibed this principle, that God
must be propitiated by devotione, mutter over their prayers
Ι without meditation. But believers ought to be exceediugly
cautious, never to enter into the presence os God to present any
petitiou, without being inflamed with aferveut affectiones saul,
and feeling au ardent desire to obtain it from him. Moreover,
although in those things which we request only for the Divino
glory, we do not at the first glauce appear to regard our own
necessity, yet it is incumbent ou us to pray sor thern with
equal servour and vehemenco of desire. As when we pray that
