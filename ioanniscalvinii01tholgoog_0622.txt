formulary were written for this purpose, containing and stating,
iu a familiar manner, all the articles of our religion, in which
the universal Church of believers ought to agree, without
any controversy: a boy of ten years of age might present
himself to make a confession of his faith; he might be ques·
tioned on all the articles, and might give suitable answers: if
he were ignorant os any, or did not fully understand them, he
should be taught. Thus the Church would witness his profes·
sion of the only true and pure saith, in which all the community
of believers unanimously worship the one God. If this discipline
were observed in the present day, it would certainly sharpen
the inactivity of some parents, who carelessly neglect the in·
struction of their children as a thing in which they have no
concam, but which, in that case, they could not omit without
public disgrace; there would be more hannouy of saith among
Christian people, nor would many betray such great ignorance
and want of information3 some would not be so easily carried
away with novel and strange tenets; in short, all would have a
regular acquaintance with Christian doctrine.

PENANCE.

XIV. In the next place, they add penance; of which they
treat in such a confused and disorderly manner, that the con-
sciences of men can deduce no certain or solid conclusion re·
specting their doctrine. In another part of this treatise, we
have stated at large what we leam from the Scripturas respect·
ing repentance, and likewise what is inculcated on that subject
by the Romanists. Our present business is only to inquire
briefly into the reasons of those persons who promulgated the
opinion which has prevailed fora long period in the churches and
in the schools, that penance is a sacrament. In the first place,
1 will make a few remarks on the practice of the ancient
Ohurch, the pretence of which they have abused for the intro·
duction and establishment of their foolish invention. The
order observed by the ancients in public penitence was, that
persons who had completed the satisfactions enjoined upon
them, were reconciled to the Church by solemn imposition of
hands. This was a sign of absolution, to encourage the sinner
himself withan assurance of pardon before God, and to ad·
monish the Chnrch that they ought to obliterate the memory
of his offanae, and kindly to receive him into favour. 'l'his
cyprian often calls “giving peace.” To increase the impor-
tance of this act, and give it a greater recommendation among
the people, it was ordained that it should always be done by
the authority of a bishop. Hence that decree of the second
