are treated by these syllable-buntaro, when they persuade the
simple to believe that we derogata from the authority due to
the words os Christ, which we have proved to be outrageonaly
perverted and confounded by them, bnt to be faithfully and
accurately explained by us.

XXIV. But the infamy of this falsehood cannot be entirely
effaced, without repelling another calumny; for they accuse
us of being so devoted to human reason, as to limit the power
os God by the order of nature, and to allow him no more than
our own understanding teaches us to ascribe to him. against
such iniquitous aspersions 1 appeal to the doctrine which 1 have
maintained 3 which will sufficiently evince that l am sar from
measuring this mystery by the capacity of human reason, or
subjecting it to the laws of nature. le it from natural philoso-
phy that we have learned that Christ feeds our souls with his
flesh from heaven, just as our bodies are nourished with bread
and wine? Whence is it that flesh has the power of giving
life to our soulsl Every one will pronounce it not to be from
nature. No more will it accord with human reason that the
flesh of Christ descends to ns to become nourishment to us.
ln short, whoever shall understand our doctrine, will be enrap-
tured with admiration os the secret power of God. But these
good zealots contrive a miracle‚ without which God himself,
with all his power, disappears from their view. 1 would again

heaven. We say that Christ descende to us both by the exter-

with the substance of his flesh and blood. He who perceives
not that many miracles are comprehended in these few words,
is more than stupid3 forthere is nothing more preternatural
than for sonls to derive spiritual and heavenly life from the
flesh, which had its origin from the earth, and was subject to
death3 nothing is more incredible than sor things separated
from each other by all the distance of heaven and earth, not·
withstanding that immense local distance, to be not only con·
nected, but united, so that our souls receive nourishment from
the flesh of Christ. Let these sanatics, then, no longer attempt
to render us odious by such asoul calumny, as though we,
in any respect, limited the infinite power os God; which is
either a most stupid mistake, or an impudent falsehood. For
the question here respects not what God could do, but what he
has chosen to do. We affirm that what pleased him, came to
pass. lt pleased him for Christ to become in all respecta like
