king ought to govern tha whole world. Their meaning is,
that one kingdom does not admit of two kings, and that no
prinae can bear a pertner in his throne.

IX. But supposing it to be, as they contend, good and
useful that the whole world should be comprehended in ona
monarohy, which, however, is a monstrons absurdity; but if
this were admitted, Ι should not, therefore, grant the same system
to be applicable to the govemment of the Churoh. For the
Chnrch hes Christ for its sole Head, under whose sovereignty we
are all united together, according to that order and form of gov-
ernment which ha himself has prescribed They offer a gross
insult to Christ, therefore, when they assign tha preeminence
over the universal Church to ona man, under the pretence
that it may not be destitute of a head For “Christ is the
head ; from whom the whole body, titly joined together, and

increase of the body. ’' (a) We saa how he places all man,
without exception, in tha body, reserving to Christ alone tha
honour and narne of head. We see how he assigna to all
the members respectively a certain measure, and a determi-
nate and limited function3 so that the perfectiones grace, as
well as the supreme power of govemment, resides in Christ
alone. l am aware of their usual cavil in evasion of thie
argument-that Christis properly styled the sole Head, be·
cause he alone govema by hia own authority and in his own
name, but that thiais no reason why there may not be under

him another maistamel band, as their phrase is, to act ns his ,

vicegerens on earth But they gain nothing by this eavil,
except they first prove that this ministry was ordained by
Christ. For the agrestia taaches, that all the subordinate minis·
tration is distributed among the members, but that the power
proceeds from that one heavenly Head. (o) Or, if they wish
me to spealr in plainer terme, since the Scriptura declaras
Christ to bathe Hasd, aad ascribes this honour to him alona,
it ought not to be transferred to any other, except to one
whom Christ himself has appointed his representative. But
such arr appointment ia-not only nowhere to be found, bnt
may be abundantly refuted by various passages.

X. Paul gives us a lively description of the chumh on
various occasions, but without making any mention of its
having one head upon earth. On the contrary, frorn the de·
scription which he gives, we may rather infer that such a
notionis foreign from tha institution of Christ. Christ, at
his mennon, withdraw from us his visible presence3 never·
