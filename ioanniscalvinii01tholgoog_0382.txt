under their yoke‚ they appear well adapted to promote humility.
Lastly, they are regarded as the expedients os prudence, from
their supposed tendency to restrain corporeal indulgence, and
to subdue sensuality by the rigour of abstinence. But what
does Paul say to these things? Does he strip off such disguises,
that the simple may not be deluded by salse pretencesl Satis·
fied that he had said enough to refute them, when he had
called them “the commandments and doctrines of men,’' (d)
he passes over all these things as undeserving os any particular
refutation. And knowing that all services os human invention
are condemned in the Church,and ought to excite the suspicion
of believers in proportion to the pleasure they afford to the
minds of men; knowiug that salse appearance of external
bumility to be at such an immense distance from true hnmility,
that it might be easily distinguished from it; knowing that
discipline to be entitled to no other consideration than as a mere
exercise of the body, -he intended these very things, by which
the traditione ol men are reconrmended to the ignorant, to serve
as their refutation with believers.

spectators with empty pomp. lspeak os those ceremonies under
which, the Roman doctors contend, are concealed great myste-
ries‚ but which, on examination, we find to be mere mockeries.
And it is not to be wondered at, that the authors and advocates
of them have fallen into such sollyas to delude both themselves
and others with contemptible absurdities; because they have

taken their model in some things from the reveries ot the .

heathen, and in others, without any judgment, have imitated
the ancient rites of the Mosaic law, which were no more appli-
cable to us than the sacrifices of animals and other similar
ceremonies. Indeed, it there were no argument besides, yet no
man in his senses would expect any thing good srom sucha
heterogeneous compound. And the fact itself plainly demon·
strates, that numerous ceremonies have no other use than to
stupesy the people, instead of instructing them. So hypocritas
attach great importance to those novel canons, which overturn
