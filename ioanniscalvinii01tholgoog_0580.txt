οΓ rt can be found „though if rt had been agreeable to God, it
would not have been omitted; but even in direct opposition to
the Scripture, forsaking the living God ,they have fabricated a
new deity, according to their own wayward inclinatione. For
what rs idolatry, if rt be not to worship the gifts instead of the
givet himself? In which they have fallen into a double sin ; for
the honour has been taken away from God, to be transferred to
the creature ; and God himself has also been dishonourcd by the
pollution and profanation of his gift, when his holy sacrament
hasbeen made an execrable idol. Let us, on the contrary, lest
we fall into the same danger, fix our ears, our eyes, our minda,
and our tongues, entirely on the sacred doctrine of God. For
that is the school of the Holy Spirit, the best of all teachcrs;
whose instructions require nothing to be added from any other
quarter, and omit nothing of which we ought not to be willing
'to remain in ignorance.

XXXVII. Now, as superstition, when it has once gone be·
yond the proper limits, proceeds in sinning without end, they
have wandcred still further; they have invented ceremonias
altogether incompatible with the institution of the sacred sup-
per, for the sole purpose of giving divine honours to the sign.
When wc remonstrate with them, they reply, that they pay*
this veneration to Christ. In the first place, if this were done
in the supper, 1 would still say that that is the only legitimate
adcretion, which terminates not in the sign, but is directed to
Christ enthroned in heaven. Now, what pretence have they
for alleging that they worship Christ in the bread, when they
have no promise of such a thing? They consecrate their host,
as they call it, to carry it about in procession, to display itin
- pomp, and to exhibit rt in a box, to be seen, adored, and rn-
volced hythe people. linquire how they consider it to be
rightly consecrated. They immediately adduce these words:

“This rs my body.'’ l object, that it was said at the same
time,‘ ‘Talia and eat.” And 1 have sufficient reason for this;
for when a promise is annexed to a precept, it isso included in
the precept, that, separated from it, it ceases to be a promise at
all. This shall be further elucidated by a similar example.
The Lord gave a command, when he said, “Call upon me ; ”
he added a promise, “l will deliver thee.”(}r) If any one
should invoke Peter or Paul, and boast of this promise, will not
his conduct be universally condemned? And wherein would
this differ from the conduct of those who suppress the command

to eat, and lay hold of the mutilated promise, “This rs my
body, in order to misapply' rt to ceremonies foreign from the
institution of Christ? Let us remember, then, that this pro-
