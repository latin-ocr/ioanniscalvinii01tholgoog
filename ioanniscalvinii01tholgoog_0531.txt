8. He objecta, that 11 they are new men, they ought to be
fed with spiritual food. The answer is easy-that they are
admitted into 1110 110011 01 0111101 by baptism, and that the
symbol of that adoption is sufficient for 111010, 1111 they grow to
an age capable of bearing solid food ; and that it is therefore ’
necessary to wait for the time 01 that examination, which Cod
expressly requires in 1110 sacred supper. 9. Ηο next objecta,
that Christ invites all his people to the sacred supper. I
answer, it is sufficiently clear that 110 admits 0000 1101 00011
as are already prepared to celebrate 1110 remembrance of his
death. Whence it follows, that infants, whom he condescended
to take into his arms, remain in a distinct and peculiar class,
till they grow to riper years, and yet that they are 001 strangers
to 1110 Church. 'l'o 11110110 objecta, that it is a monstrous thing
fora person that is born, not to eat. 1 reply, that the external
participation 01 1110 supper is not the only way 10 which souls
are fed3 and therefore that Christ is 10011 10 1010010, notwith-
standing they abstain from 1110 sign ; bnt that the 0000 01 11ορ-
11010 10 different, by which alone they are admitted into the
Church. He further objects, that “a faithful and wisc servant,
whom his lord 110111 made 10101 0101 1110 110000110111, giveth them
meat 10 dne season.’'(p) This I readily grant: but by what
authority will he determine the time 01 baptism 101 us, so 00
10 prove that it 10 001 administered 10 1111011ῑο 01 0 proper 11010 i
10. He likewise adduces 1110 command 01 Christ to his apostles,
to hasten 10 1110 harvest, while 1110 fields are whitening. (q)
The sole design of Christ 00 11101 occasion wasto stimulate 1110
apostles, that, seeing the present srnit 01 111011 10110010, they
might 011011 themselves in their ministry with the greater 011001- ·

1110 only 11100 proper 101 baptism? ll. His next argument is,
that in 1110 primitive Church Christiana and disciplas were 1110
same persons. (r) But here we see that he injudiciously
reasons from 0 part 101110 whole. 'Phe appellation 01 disciples
was given to persons 01 adult age, who had been already in·
structed, and had made a profession 01 Christianity; just as the
Jews under 1110 law were 1110 disciples of Moses, yet 00000 can
justly 1010111010 11110, that infants were strangers, God having
declared 111010 10 be part of 1110 family. 12. Moreover 110
alleges, that all Christiana 010 1110111100, but that we treat infants
