it by the royal dignity. “And he said, The Lord forbid that
l should do this thing unto my master, the Lord's anointed, to
stretch forth mine hand against him, seeing he is the anointed of
the Lord.’' Again: “Mine eye spared thee ; and Ι said,l will
not put forth mine hand against my lord; for he is the Lord's
anointed.” (b) Again: “ Who can stretch forth his hand against
the Lord’s anointed, and be guiltless? As the Lord liveth, the
Lord shall smite him ; or his day shall corne to die, or he shall
descend into battle, and perish. The Lord forbid that l should
stretch forth mine hand against the Lord's anointed.” (c)
XXIX. Finally, we owe these sentiments of affection and
reverence to all our rulerS, whatever their characters may be3
which l the more frequently repeat, that we may learn not to
scrutinize the persons themselveS, but may be satisfied with
kuowing that they are invested by the will of the Lord with
that function, upon which he has irnpressed an inviolable
majesty. But it will be said, that rulers owe mutual duties to
their subjects. That Ι have already confessed. But he who
infers from this that obedience ought to be rendered to none
but just rulers, is a very bad reasoner, For husbands owe
mutual duties to their wives, and parents to their children.
Now, if husbands and parents violate their obligations, if
parents conduct themselves with discouraging severity and
fastidious moroseness towards their children, whom they are
forbidden to provolre to wrath ; (d) if husbands despise and vex
their wives, whom they are commanded to love and to spare as
the weaker vessels ; (a) does it follow that children should be
less obedient to their parents, or wives to their husbands?
They are still subject, even to those who are wicked and
unkind. As it is incumbent on all, not to inquire into the
duties of one another, but to confine their attention respectively
to their own, this consideration ought particularly to be re·
garded by those who are subject to the authority of others.
Wherefore, if we are inhumanly harassed by a cruel prince; if
we are rapaciously plundered by an avarieious or luxurious one;
if we are neglected byan indolent one; or if we are persecuted,
on account of piety, by an impious and sacrilegious one, —let
us first call to mind our transgressions against God, which
he undoubtedly chastises by these scourges. Thus our impa-
tience will be restraiued by humility. Let us, in the next
place, consider that it is not our province to remedy these evils ;

and that nothing remains forus, but to implore the aid of the
Lord, in whose hand are the hearts of kings and the revolutione
of kingdoms. lt is “ God ” who ‘⁴ standeth in the congregation
