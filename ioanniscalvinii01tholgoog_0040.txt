This sentiment is beautifnlly suggested hythe Psalmist when
he thus addresses the Lord: “There is forgiveness with thee,
that thou mayest be feared ; ’' (z) for he shows that there is no
worship of God without an acknowledgment of his mercy, on
which alone it is both founded and established. And this well
deserves to be remarked, in order that we may know, not only
that the true worship of God arises from areliance on his
merny, but that the fear of God (which the Papists hold to ba
meritorious)eannot be dignified with the title osmerii, because
it is founded in the pardon and remission of sins.

lv. But the most futile of all their calumnies is, that men
are encouraged to the practice of sin by our maintaining the
gratuitous remissiori of sinS, in which we make rightconsrress to
consist. For we say that so great a blessing could never ba
compensated by any virtue of oure, and that therefore it could
never be obtained, unless it were gratuitously bestowed3 more·
over, that it is gratuitous to us indeed, but not so to Christ,
whom it eost so much, even his own most sacred blood, beside
which no price sufficiently valuable could be paid to Divine
justice. When men are taught in this manner, they are ap-
prized that it is not owing to them that this most sacred blood
is not shed as often as they sin. Besides, we learn that such
is our pollution, that it can never be washed away, except in
the fountain of this immaculate blood. Must not persons who
hear these things conceive a greater horror of sin, than if it
were said to be cleansed by a sprinkling of good works? And
if they have any sear of God, will they not dread, after being
once purified, to plunge themselves again into the mire, and
thereby to disturb and infeet, as far as they can, the purity of
this fountaini “l have washed my feet,’' (says the believing
seul in Solomon,) “how shall Idefile them ? ²’ (a) Now, it is
plain which party better deserves the charge of degrading the
value of remissiones sins, and prostituting the dignity of
righteousness. They pretend that God is appeared by their
frivolous satisfactione, which are no better than dung ; we
assert, that the guilt of sinis too atrocious to be expiated by
such insignificant trifies; that the displeasure of God is too⁴
great to be appeased by these worthless satisfactions; and
therefore that this is the exclusive prerogative of the blood of
Christ. They say, that righteousness‚ if it ever be defective,
is restored and repaired by works of satisfaction. We think it
so valuable that no compensation of works can be adequate to
it; and therefore that for its restitution we must have reeourse
to the mercy of God alone. The remaining particulars that
pertain to the remissiones sins may be found in the next
cha ter.
