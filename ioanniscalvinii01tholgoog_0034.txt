do not signify that by saith in Christ we merely gain the
ability to attaiu rightcousness or effect our salvation, but that
both are bestowed on us. Therefore, as soon as we are
ingrafted into Christ by saith, we are already become sons of
God, heirs of heaven, partakers of righteousness, possessors of
life, and (the better to refuta their falsehoods) we have attained,
not the opportunity of meriting, but all the merits of Christ3
for they are all communicated to us. ’

Vll. Thus the Sorbouic schools, those sources of all kinds
of errors, have deprived us of justification by faith, whichia
the substance of all piety. They grant, indeed, in words, that
a man is justified by faith formed, but this they afterwards
explain to be, because faith renders good worlrs effectnal to
justification; so that their mention of saith has almost tha
appearance of mockery, since it could not be passed over in
silence, while the Scriptura is so full of it, without exposing
thern to great censure. And not content with this, they rob
God of part of the praise of good works, and transfer it to man.
Perceiving that good worlrs avail but little to the exaltation of
man, and that they cannot properly be denominatcd merita if
they be considered as the effecta of Divine grace, they darive
them from the power of free-will; which is lilre extracting oil
from a stone. They contend, that though grace be the princi·
pal cause of them, yet that this is not to the exclusion of frea·
will, from which all merit originates. And this is maintained
not only by the latter sophists, but likewiseby their master,
Lombard, whom, when compared with them, we may pro· ,
nounce to be sound and sober. Trnly wonderful was their
blindness, with Augustino so frequently in their mouths, not to
see how solicitously he endeavoured to prevent men from arro-
gating the least degree of glory on aocoiuit of good works,
Before, when we discusscd the question of free-will, we cited
from him some testimonias to this purpose3 and similar
ones frequently recur in his writings; as when he forbids us
ever to boast of our merita, since even they arethe gifts of
God3 and when he says, “that all our merit proceeds from
grace alone; that it is not obtained by our sufficiency„ but is
produced entirely by grace,'' doe. That Lombard was blind to
the light of Scriptura, in which he appears not to have been
so well versed, need not excite so much surprise. Yet nothing
could be wished for more explicit, in opposition to him aud
his disciples, than this passage of the apostle; wh0, having
interdicted Christiana from all boasting, subjoins as a reason
why boasting is unlawful, that ‘¹ we are his (God's) workman·
ship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath
before ordained that we should walk in them.'' (m) Since
