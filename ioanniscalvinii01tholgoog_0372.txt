and the Holy Spirit, in another place, pronounces that “marriage
is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled.'' (e) 'I'he prohibi·
tion, which they have since denounced, of the marriage of
priests, they wish us to consider as the true and natural inter-
pretation of the Scripturas though nothing can be imagined
more repugnant to it. tf any one dare to open his mouth to
the contrary, he is condemned as a horatio, because the deter-
mination οἱ the Church is without appeal, and the truth ol its
interpretation cannot be doubted without impiety. What further
requires to be urged against such consummate effrontery? 'l'he
mere exhibition of it is a sufficient refutation. Their pietensions
to confirm the Scripture by the authority ol the Church,l
purposely pass over. Tosubject the oracles of God to the
authority of men, so as to make their validity dependent on
human approbation, is a blasphemy unworthy of being men·
tioned; beside which, Ihave touched on this subject already.
Iwill only ask them one question: 11 the authority of the Serip-
ture be founded on the approbation of the Church, what decree os
any council can they allege to this point? I believe, none at all.
Why, then, did Arius suffer himself to be vanquished at Nice by
testimonias adduced from the Gospel of John? According to
the argument of our opponente, he was at liberty to reject them,
as not having yet received the approbation of any general council.
They allega an ancient catalogue, which is called the Canon
os Scriptum, and which they say proceeded from the decision
os the Church. 1 ask them again, in what coancil that canon
was composed. Το this they can make no reply. Yet Iwould
wish to be further insonned, what kind ot‘ a canon they suppose
it to be. For 1 see that the ancient writers were not sully
agreed respecting it. And is any weight be attached to the
testimony os Jerome, the two books of the Maccabeos, the history
of Tobit, Ecclesiasticus, and other books, will be considered as
apocrypha} ; to which our opponente will by no means consent
