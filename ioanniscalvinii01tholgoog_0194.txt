001010 11100 doubts respecting our final destiny.

VIII. The declaration 01 Christ, that “ many are called,
and few chosen,” is very improperly understood. For there
will be no ambiguity iu it, 11 we remember what must be clear
from the foregoing observatione, that there are two kinds of
calling. For 111010 10 0 universal 0011, by which God, iu 1110
external preaching of 1110 word, invites all, indiscriminately, to
come 10 him, even those to whom he intends it as a savour of
death, and 00 occasion of heavier condemnation. There is also

causes 1110 word preached to, sink into their hearts. Yet 00100-
times 110 0100001010001001001110111000 whom 110 only enlighteus
for a season, aud afterwards forsalres on account 01 their iugra-
titudo, aud strikes with greater blindness. Now, the Lord, see·
ing the gospel published far aud wide, held in contempt by
the generality 01 men, and justly appreciated by few, gives us
a description of God, under 1110 character 01 0 king, who preparas
a solemn feast, aud sends out his messengers in every directiou,
10 invite a great company, but can only prevail on very few,
every one allegiug impediments to excuse himself 3 οο 11101 01
length he is constrained by their refusal to bring in all who can
be found iu the streets. Thus 101, every 000 sees, 1110 00101)Ῑο
10 10 be understood of the extemel call. He proceeds 10 inform
us, that God acts like a good master 01 0 feast, walkiug round
the tables, courteously receiving his guests; but 1110111110 finds
any one not adorned with a nuptial garment, 1100011010 not the
meauness of such a person 10 disgrace 1110 festivity 01 1110
banquet. l confess, this part is to be understood 01 those who
enter into the Church by a profession 01 101111, but are not
invested with 1110 sanctification of Christ. Such blemishes, aud,
as it were, 0001101001 1110 Ghurch, God will 001 always suffer, but
will 0001 111010 001 01 11, as their turpitude deserves. Fow,
therefore, are 0110000 001 01 0 multitude that are called, but
not with that calling by which we say believers ought 10 judge
01 their 01001100. For the former is common also to the wicked;
but the latter is attended with the Spirit 01 regeneration, the
0010001 and saal 01 1110 future iuheritance, which 00010 001 1100110

01 piety 00 11 they were true worshippers of God, Christ
declares that 110 will finally cast them out 01 the place which
they unjustly occupy. ’11100 the Psalmist says, “Who shall
abide iu thy tabernacle? He that worketh righteousness‚ aud

spealroth the 110111 10 1110 heart.'’ (c) Again: “'I'his is the
