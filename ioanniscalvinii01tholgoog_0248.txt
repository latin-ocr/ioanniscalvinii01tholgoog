the mysteries less pure and salutary to a holy and upright
man, because they are received at the same time by the impure.

XX. 'l'heir severity and baughtiness go to still greater
lengths Aeknowledging no ehurch but such as is pure from
the smallest blemisbes, they are even angry with honest teachers,
because, by exhorting believers to progressive improvements,
they teach them to groau under the burden of sins, and to seek
for pardon all their lifetime. For hereby, they pretend, the
people are drawn away from perfectiori. Ι confess, that iu

Therefore, in the Creed, tlte communion os saints is imme·
diately followed by tlte forgiveness os sins, which cau only be
obtained by the citizens and members of the Church, as we
read in the prophet. (i) The heavenly Jerusalem, therefore,
ought first to be built, in which this favour of God may be
enjoyed, that whoever shall enter it, their iniquity shall be
blotted out. Non, 1 affirm that this ought first to be built;
not that there can ever be any Church without remission of
sins, but because God has not promised to impart his marey,
except in the communion of saints. Our first entrance, there-

sins, without which we have no covenant or union with God.

a covenant for them with the beasts of the field, and with the
fowls of heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground;
and Ι will break the bow and the swerd, and the battle out of
the earth, aud will make them to lie down safely. And 1 will
betroth thee unto me for ever‚· yea, Ι will betroth thee unto me
iu righteousness, and in judgment, arrd in loving-kindness, and
in mercios.” (lc) We see how God reconciles us to himself byhis

that we are initiated into the society of his Church; by which
we are taught that there is no admittanoe for us into the fa·

XXI. Nor does God only once receive and adopt us into his
Church by the remissiori of sins3 he likewise preserves aud
keeps usin it by the same mercy. For to what purpose would
