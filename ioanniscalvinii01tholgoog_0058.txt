blessed of my Father; for Ι was a hungcred, and ye gave me
meat: 1 was thirsty, and ye gave me drink,'' &a (lc) And
with these let us also connect those which represent eternal
life as the reward of works‚ such as the following: “ The re·
compensa of a man’s hands shall be rendered unto him.'' (l)
“He that feareth the commandmeut shall be rewarded.'' (m)
“ Rejoice and be exceeding glad ; for great is your reward in
heaven.” (n) “Every one shall receive his own reward, ac-
cording to his own labour.'²(o) The declaration, that God
will render to every one according to his works‚ is easily ex·
plaiued. For that phrase indicates the order of events, rather
than the cause of them. But it is beyond all doubt, that the
Lord proceeds to the consummation of our salvation by these
several gradations of mercy: “ Whom he hath predestinated,
them he calls; whom he hath called, he justifies3 and whom
he hath justified, he finally glorifies.’' (p) Though he receives
his children into eternal lile, therefore, of his mere mercy, yet
since he conducts thern to the possession of it through a course
of good works‚ that he rnay fulfil his work in them in the order
he has appointed, we need not wonder if they are said to be
rewarded according to their works‚ by which they are un·
doubtedly prepared to receive the crown of immortality. And
for this reason, they are properly said to “work out their own
salvation,'’ (q) while, devoting themselves to good works‚ they

they obtain eternal life by believing in Christ, and yet it is
immediately added, “which the Son of man shall give urrto
you.” (r) Whence it appears that the word work is not op-
posed to grace, but refers to human endeavours; and there·
fore it does not follow, either that believers are the authors of
their own salvation, or that salvation proceeds from their works‚
But as soon as they are introduced, by the knowledge of the
gospel and the illumination of the Holy Spirit, into commn-
nion with Christ, eternal life is beguu in them. Now, “the
good work which ’¹ God “hath begrm in '² them, “ he will per-
form until the day of Jesus Christ.'' (s) Audit is performed,
when they prove themselves to be the genuine children of God
bydtheir resemblance to their heavenly Father in righteousness
an holiness.

good works are the cause of salvation. First, let this truth be
established in our minds, that the kingdom of heaven is not
