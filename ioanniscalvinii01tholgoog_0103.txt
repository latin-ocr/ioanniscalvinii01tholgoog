the Psalms he expostulares with the Jews, because, aster having
experienced his propitiousness to their prayers, they had almost
immediately returned to their native perverseness. (t) lt is
evideut, also, from the history of the Judges, that whenever
they wept, though their tears were hypocritical, yet they were
delivered from the hands of their enemies. As the Lord, there·
sore, “makcth his sun to rise on the evil audon the good‚’' (n)
promiscuously, so he despises not the lamentations of those
whose cause is just, aud whose afflictione deserve relies. At
the same time his attention to them is no more connected with
salvatiou, than his furnishing iood to the despisers os his good·
ness. The question relative to Abraham and Samuel is attend·
ed with more difficulty, the sonucr of whom prayed sor the
inhabitants os Sodom without any Divine directim, and the
latter sor Saul even contrary to a plain prohibition. (v) The
same is the case of Jeremiah, who deprecated the destruction
of the city. (w) For though they suffered a repulse, yet it
seems harsh to deny them to have been under the influencc of
saith. But the modest reader will,l hope, be satisfied with
this solution ; that mindsul os the general principles by which
God enjoius them to be mercisul even to the unworthy, they
were not entirely destitute of saith, though ina particular in·
stance their opinion may have disappointed them. Augustius
has somewhere this judicious observation: “How do the saints
pray in saith, when they implore os God that which is contrary
to his dearces? Itis because they pray according to his will, not
that hidden aud immutable will, but that with which he inspires
them, that he may hear them in a different way, as he wisely
discrimirrates.” This is an excellent remark; because, accord-
ing to his incomprehensible designs, he so regulates the events os
things, that the prayers os the saints, which cohtain a mixture

. of saith and error, are not in vain. Yet this no more aliords

au example sor imitation, than a sufficient plea to excuse the
saints themselves, whom l admit to have transgressed thc
bouuds of duty. Wherefore, when uncertain promise can be
found, wc should present our supplicatious to God in a condi·
tioual way, which is implied iu this petitiou oi David:
“Awalre to the judgment that thou hast commanded, ”(c)
because he suggests that he was directed by a particular revela-
tion to pray for a temporal blessing.

XVI. It will also be os use to remark, that the things Ι have
delivered concerniug the four rules sor praying aright, are not
required by God with such extreme rigour as to cause the re·

jectiou of all prayers, iu which he does not find a perscction os
