corrupt prostitution os that which is declared to be reserved par-
ticularly for the children of the church. At present let this suf·
fice, that though the voice of the gospcl addresses all men gene-
rally, yet the gift os saith is bestowed on few lsaiah assigna the
cause, that “ the arm os the Lord '³ is not ‘¹ revealed ’² to all. (i)
Ifhe had said, that the gospel is wickedly and perversely despised‚
because many obstinately resuse to hear it, perhaps there would
be some colour sor this notion of the universal call. 'l'he design
os the prophet is not to extenuate the guilt os men, when he
states that the sourcc of blindness is God’s not deigning to
reveal his arm to them 3 he only suggests that their ears are in
vain assailed with external doctrine, because saith is a preculiar
gift. 1 would wish to be informed by these teachers, whether
men become children os God by mere preaching, or by saith.
Surely‚ when John declares that all who believe in God’s only
begotten Son, are themselves made the children os God, (lc) this
is not said os all the hearers os the word in a confused mass, but
a particular rank is assigned to believers, “which were born,
not os blood, nor cf the will os the dash, nor os the will os man,
but os God.’' (l) But they say, there is a mutual agreement
between saith and the word. This is the case wherever there
is any saith3 but it is no new thing for the seed to fall among
thorns or in stony places ; not only because most men are evi·
dently in actual rebellion against God, but because they are not
all endued with eyes and ears. Where, then, will be the consis-
tency os God’s calling to himself such as he knows will never
come? Let Augustine answer sor me: “Do you wish to dis·
puta with me? Rather unite with me in admiration, and ex·
claim, O the depth! Let us both agree in sear, lest we perish
in error.'’ Resides, if election is, as Paul represents it, the
parent os saith, 1 retort that argument upon them, that saith
carmot be general, because election is special. For from the
connection of causes and effects, it is easily inferred‚ when Paul
says, “ God hath blessed us with all spiritual blessings‚ according
aa he hath chosen us before the foundation os the world ; '² that
therefore these treasures arc not common mall, because God
has chosen only such as he pleased. 'l'his is the reason why,
in another place, he commenda “the saith os God’s elect 3 '' (m)
that none may be supposed to acquire saith by any exertion os
their own, but that God may retain the glory of sreely illumi·
nating the objects os his previous election. For Bemard justly
observes, “ Friends hear each one sor himself when he addresses
them, ‘Fear not, little flock, sor to you it is given to know the
mystery os the kingdom of heaven) Who are these? Certainly
those whom he has foreknown and predestinated to be con·
