by desperate circumstances, he has reconrse to God, the Author
of life, unto whom, as the Psalmist says, “belong the issues
from death.” (a) Even reduced to a state resembling adead
carcass more than a living man, yet relying on the power of '
God, just as if he were in perfect health, Job looks forward
without any doubts to that day. “I knowss’ says he, “that
my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day
upon the earth,'' there to display his power3 “and though after
my skin, worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall 1 see
God; whom Ι shall see for myself, and not another.’' (t) For
though some persons employ great subtilty to pervert these
texts, as if they ought not to be understood of the resurrection,
they nevertheless confirm what they wish to destroy; since
holy men, in the midst of calamities, seek consolation from no
other quarter than from the similitude of the resurrection;
which more fully appears from a passage in Ezekiel. (a) For
when the Jews rejected the promise of their restoration, and
objected, that there was no more probability of a way being
opened for their return, than of the dead coming forth from
their sepulchres, a vision is presented to the prophet, of a field
full of dry bones, and God commanda them to receive flesh
and nerves. Though this figure is intended to inspire the
people with a hope of restoration, he borrows the argument for
it from the resurrection; as it is to us also the principal model
of all the delivemncei which believers experience in this
world. So Christ, after having declared that the voice of the
gospel communicates life,' rn consequence of' rts rejection by
the Jews, immediately adds, “Marvel not at this; for the honr
is coming, in the which all that are in the graves shall hear
his voice, and shall come forth.''(c) After the example of

Paul, therefore, let us even now triumphantly exult in the
midst of our conflicts, that he who has promised us a life to
come “is able to keep that which we have committed to him; ”
and thus let us glory that‘ ‘'there rs laid up for us a crown of

righteorrsnam, which the righteous Judge shall give us. Ὃ)
The consequence of this will be, that all the troubles we suffer
will point us to the life to come,‘ ‘seeing it is a righteous thing
with God,” and agreeable to his’ nature,‘ ‘to recompensa tribu-

lation to them that trouble us,and tous who are ’' unjustly
“ troubled, rest, when the Lord Jesus shall be revealed, with his
mighty angele, in flaming fire.’' (z) But we must remember
what immediately follows, that ‘,‘ he shall come to be glorified
in his saints, and to be admired in all them that believe,'' be·
cause they believe the gospel.
