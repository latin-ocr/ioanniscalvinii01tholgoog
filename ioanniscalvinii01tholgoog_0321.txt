Vincentius attended the council ou the hehals ol' Julius, who
at that time presided over the Church ol' Rome. They were
mted in the fourth place, ls Julius had been aeknotrledged
as the head ol the Charch, would his representatires hare been
degraded to the fourth seat? Would Athanasius have presided
in a general coancil, where the form os the hierarchica} system
ought most particularly to have been oboerved? ln the council
ot' Ephesus, it appears that celestine, who was theu bishop ot'
Rome, made use οι· adisingenuous artifice to secure the diguity
ot' his we. For wheu he sent his legates thither, he requested
Cyril, patriarch ot' Alexandria, who was otherwise to preside, to

tinople, and acquitted Eutyches, and sanctioned his heresy.
But when the couucil was assembled, aud the bishops took
their respective seats, it is certain that the legates of the Roman
Ohurch were present among the others, asin aholy and legitimate
coancil. Yet they contended not sor the first place, but yielded
it to another, which they would not have done if they had
considered it as belonging to them. l'or the bishops of Rome
hare never been ashamed of raising the greatest contentione sor
their dignit y, and they have not hesitated‚ on this account alone,

to harass aud agitate the Charch with various and pernicious
