where John says, “ 'I'he Holy Ghost 1000 1101 yet, because that
Jesns was not yet glorified.'’ (u) For 11 they obstinately ad-
here to their rule, they will destroy the eternal existence 01 the
spirit, esis it commenced at the ascension 01 Christ. Let them
answer, in the last place, what is the meaning 01 Paul, when
he calls baptism “the washing 01 regeneration, and renew-
ing,” (o) though it is evidently useless to many. But nothing
is more conclusive against them than that passage where Paul
says, that the Church is Christ. For having drawn a similitude
from the human body, he adds, “ So 0100 10 Christ ; '² (w) by
which he means not the only begotten Son 01 God, in himself,
but in his members. 1 think l have so 101 succeeded, that all
men 01 001100 and integrity must be disgusted with the foul
calumnies 01 0111 adversaries, when they charge us with giving
no credit to the words 01 Christ, which we receive with as
much submission as themselves, and consider with greater re·
verence. Indeed, their supine negligence is a proof that it is a
subject 01 little concern to them, what was the will or meaning
01 Christ, provided they can use him as a shield to defend their
obstinacy; as our diligenee in inquiring into Christ’s true
meaning is a sufficient proof 01 our high regard to his authori·
ty. They maliciously represent, that human reason prevents
us from believing what Christ himself has declared with his
sacred mouth, but how unjustly they stigmatize us with this

reproach,l have explained, in a great measure, already, and ι

shall presently make still more evident. Nothing preventa us,
therefore, from believing Christ when he speaks, and immedi-
ately acquiescing in every word he 1111010. The only question
is, whether it be criminal to inquire into his genuine meaning.

explained in afigurative sense, I hesitate not to consider it 00 0

other pretext that the ancient Anthropomorphites molested the
orthodox fathers, than by laying hold 01 such expressions as
these: “The eyes 01 the Lord behold, lt entereth into the
ears 01 the Lerd; His hand is stretched ont; The earth is his
footstool ; '¹ and accusing 111011101 depriving God 01 his body,

in the crudest barbarism. 1101 what monstrous absurdities will
