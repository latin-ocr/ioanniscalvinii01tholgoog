them as already lost. It inproper to consider them aa strangam
ιο the Church, and consequently from Christ, but this only as
long aa they romain ina state os exclusion. And even then,
isthey exhibit more appearance of obstinacy than os humility,
still let us leave them ιο ιοο judgment of God, hoping better
things os them for the future than we discover at present, and
not ceasing to pray to God on their behals. And to compre·
bend all in a word, let us not condemn to eternal death the
person himself, who is in the hand and power os God alone,
but let us content ourselvea with judging os the nature of hia
works according ιο the law of the Lord. While we follow this
rute, we rather adhere to the judgment of God than pronounce
our own. Let us not arrogate to ourselves any greater latitudo
of judging‚ unless we would limit the power and prescribe lawe
to the mercy os God ς sor, whenever it seems good tobim,
the worat os men are changed into the best, strangers are in·
troduced‚ arrd foreigners are admitted into the Churcb. And
this the Lord does, ιο frustrate the opinion and represa the
presumption of meu, which would usurp the most unwarrant·
able liberty of judging, is it were left without any restraint.

X. When Christ promises that what his ministers bind on
earth shall be bound in heaven, he limits the power os binding
to the censure of the Ghurch; by which those who are excom-
municated are not cast into etemal min and condemnation, but,
by hearing their lise and conduct condemned, are also certified
of their final condemnation, unless they repent. For excom·
manication differs from anathema3 the latter, which ought to
be very rarely or never resorted to, precluding all pardon,
execrates a person, and devotos him to eternal perditiorr;
whereas excommunication rather censures and punishes his
conduct. And though it does, at the same time, punish the
person, yet it ia in such a manner, that, by warning him os his
future condemnation‚ it recalls him ιο salvation. lt he obey, the
Ohurch is ready to reedmit him to its friendship, and to restore
him to its communion. Therefore, though the discipline of
the Ohurch admits not os our friendly association and familiar

intercourse with excommunicatcd persons, yet we ought to ,

exert cll the means in our power to promote their reformatiom
and their return ιο the society and communion of the Chnrch;
as we are taught by the apostle, who says, “Yet count him not
as an enemy, but admonish him aa a brother.'’ (o) Unless this
tendemess be observed by the individua} members, as well as
by the Church collectively, our discipline will be in danger os
speedily degenerating into cruelty.
