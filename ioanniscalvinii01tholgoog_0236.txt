he affirms, in another Epistle, that his “ gospel came not in word
only, but also in power.'’ ( s ) He declares also to the Galatians,
that they “received the Spirit by the hearing of faith.'' (g) ln
short, there are several places, in which he not only represents
himself as a “ labourer together with God,” (h) but even attrl·
butes to himself the office of communicating salvation. He
certainly never advanced all thesethings, in order to arrogare to
himself the least praise independent of God, as he briefly states
in other passages: “ Our entrance in unto you was notin vain.”(r')
“l labour, striving according to his working, which worketh in
me mightily.” (lc) “ He that wrought etl'ectually in Peter to the
apostleship of the circumcision, the same was mighty in me
toward the Gentiles.'’ (l) Besides, it is evident, from other
places, that he leaves ministers possessed of nothing, considered
in themselves: “ Neither is he that planteth any thing, neither
he that watereth; but God that givcth the increase.'’ (m)
Again: “I laboured more abundantly than they all 3 yet not 1,
but the grace of God which was with me.” (a) And it is cer-
tainly necessary to bear in memory those passages, in which
God ascribes to himself the illumination of the mind and reno·
ration of the heart, and thereby declares it to be sacrilege for
man to arrogare to himself any share in either. Yet every one
who attends with docility of mind to the ministers whom God
has appointed, will leam from the beneficial effect, that this
mode of teaching has not in vain been pleasing to God, and
that this yolre of modesty has not without reason been imposed
upon believers.

Vll. From what has been said, Ι conceive it must now be
evident what judgment we ought to form respecting the Ghurch,
which is visible to our eyes, and falls under our knowledge.
For we have remarked that the word Charch is used in the sa·
cred Scriptures in two senses. Sometimes, when they mention
the Ohurch, they intend that which is really such in the sight of
God, into which none are received but those who by adoption and
grace are the children of God, and by the sanctificationes the
Spirit are the true members of Christ. And then it comprehends
not only the saints at any one time resident on earth, but all the
elect who have lived from the beginning of the world. But the
word Choreb is frequently used in the Scriptures to designate the
whole multitude, dispersed all over the world, who profess to
worship one God and Jesus Christ, who are initiated into his
saith by baptism, who testify their unity in true doctrine and
charity by a participation of the sacred supper, who consent to

lmento.
