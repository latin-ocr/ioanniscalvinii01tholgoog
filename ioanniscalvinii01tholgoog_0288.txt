it was necessary to have the express consent of the body of the
people at each place. Nor is it any wonder that the people
were not very solicitous for the preservation of their right in
thrs case. For no one was made a subdeacon, who had not
been tried for a considerable time es one of the clergy, under
tlre severe discipline which was then practised. After he had
been tried in that station, he was constituted a deacon; in
which if he conducted himself with fidelity, he obtained the
ranlr of a presbyter. 'I'hus no one was promoted who had not
really undergone an examination for many years, under the
eyes of the people. And there were many canons for the
punishment of their faults3 eo that the Church could rrot be
troubled with wicked presbyters or deacons, unless it neglected
the remedies within its reach. The election of presbytera,
however, always required the consent of the inhabitants of the
place; which is testified by the first canon, which is attributed
to Anacletus. And all ordinatione took place at stated times
of the year, that no one might be introduced clandestinely,
without the consent of the faithful, or be promoted with too
much facility, without any attestation to his character.

ΧΙ. 'l'he right of voting in the election of bishops was re·
tained by the people for a long time, that rro one might be
obtruded who was not acceptable to all. The Council of Anti-
och therefore decreed, that no bishop should be appointed
without the consent of the people, which Leo the F'irst express-
ly confirma Hence the following injunctions: “Let him be
cboeen who shall be called for by the clergy and people, crat
least by the majority of them.'' Again: “Let him who is to
preside over all, be chosen by all.’' For he who is appointed '
without haring been previously known and examined, mustos
necessity be intruded by force. Again: “ Let him be elected
who shall heve been chonen by the clergy arrd desired by the
people; and let him be consecrated by the bishops of that pro·
vince, with the authority of the metropolitan. So -carefrrl were
the boly fathers that thir liberty of the people should not by
any means be infringed, that when the general council, assem·
bled at Constantinople, appointed Nectarius, they would not do
it without the approbation of all the clergy arrd people; as is
erident from their epistle to the Council of Rome. Whereforc,
when any bishop appointed his successor, the appointment was
not confirmed but by the suffrages of all the people. Of such
a circumstance we have not only an exarrrple, but the particu-
lar form in Augustine’s nomination of Eradiua. And Theodo-
ret, when he states that Peter was nominated by Athanasius as
his successor, immediately adds, that this was confirmed by
the clergy, arrd ratified by the acclamations of the magistracy,
the nobility, and all the people.
