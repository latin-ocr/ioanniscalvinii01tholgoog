to sacred actions, and is very efficacions in exciting the mind
ιο a true concern and ardour of devotion. Yet great cantion is
necessary, that the ears be not more attentive to the modulation
of the notes, than the mind to the spiritual impert of the words.
With which danger Angustiae confessas himself to have been
so affected, as sometimes to have wished for the observance of
the custom instituted by Athanasius, who directed that the
reader should sonnd the words with such a gentle inflection of
voice, as would be more nearly allied to rehearsiug than ιο
singing. But when he recollected the great benefit which
himself had received from singing, he inclined to the other
side. With the observance, therefore, of this limitation, it is
without doubt an institution of great solemnity and usefnlness.
As, ou the reverse, whatever music is composed only to please
aud delight the ear, is unbecoming the majesty of the Chureh,

are to be composed, not in Greek among the latins, nor iu
Latin among the French or English, as has hitherto been nni·
versally practised3 but in the vernacular tongne, which may
be generally understood by the whole congregation3 for it

ιο whom not the least benefit can result from sounds which

say Amen at thy giving of thanks, seeing he understandeth
not what thou sayest? For thou verily givest thanks well,

wonder at the unbridled license of the Papists, who, notwith-
standing this apostolic cantion against it, are not afraid to bel·
low their verbose prayers in a foreign language, of which they
neither sometimes understand a syllable themselves, nor wish
asyllable to be understood by others! But Paul directs to a
different practice: “What is it then? (says he) 1 will pray
with the spirit, and I will pray with the understanding also: 1
will sing with the spirit, and 1 will sing with the understand·
ing also.'' (l) Signifying by the word spirit the pecnliar gift
of tongues, which was abused by some of its possessorS, when
they separated it from understanding. Thus it must be sully
admitted, that both iu public and in private prayer, the magne,
unaccompanied by the beart, cannot but be highly displcasing
to God3 and likewisa that the mind ought to be incited, in the
