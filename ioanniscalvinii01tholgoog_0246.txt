whence it follows, that its holiness is not yet perfect. The
Ohurch, therefore, is so far holy‚ that it is daily improving,
but has not yet arrived at perfection; that it is daily ad-
vancing‚ but has not yet reached the mark of holiness; asin
another partos this work will be more sully explained. The
predictious of the prophete, therefore, that “Jerusalem shall
be holy‚ aud there shall no strangers pass through her any
more,” and that the way of God shall be a “ way ο1 holi-
ness, over which “the unclean shall not pass,’' (e) are not
to be understood as 11 there were no blemish remaining itt
any of the members of the church3 but because they aspira
with all their souls towards perfect holiness and purity, the
goodness of God attributes to them that sauctity to which they
have not yet fully attaiued. And though such evidences of
sanctification are ostentimes rarely to be found among men, yet
it must be maintained, that, from the foundation of the world,
there has never been aperiod in which God had not his Ohurch
in it; and that, to the consummationes all things, there never
will be 1 time in which he will not have his Church. For
although, in the very beginning os time, the whole human raca
was corrupted and defiled by the sin of Adam; yet, from this
polluted mass, God always sanctifies some vessels to honour, so
that there is no age which has not experienced his mercy.
Thisbe has testified by certain promises, such as the following:

“I have made a eovenant with my chosen: Ihave swern unto .

David, my servant, Thy seed will 1 establish for ever, and build
up thy throne to all generations.’' ( s ) Again: ‘⁴ The Lord
hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it 1ο1 his habitation. This .
is my rest forever.'' (g) Again: “ Thus saith the Lord, which
giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the
moon aud of the stars for a light by night: 11 those ordinauces
depart from before me, saith the Lord, then the seed os lsrael
also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever.” (lt)
XVIII. 01 this truth ChrIst himself, the apostles, aud almost
all the prophets, have given us an example. Dreadful are those
descriptions in which lsaiah, Jeremiah, J0e1‚Habakkuk‚ and
others, deplere the disorders of the Church of Jerusalem. There
was such general and extreme corruption in the people‚ iu the
magistrates, and in the priests, that lsaiah does not hesitate to
compare Jerusalem to Sodom and Gomorrah. Religion was
partly despised, partly corrupted. Their manners were gene·
rally disgraced by thefts, robberies, treacheries, murders‚ and
similar crimes. Nevertheless, the prophets on this account
neither raised themselves new churches, nor built new altars
