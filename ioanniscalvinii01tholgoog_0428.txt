that command of the apostle, to put away the wicked, (q) ought
by uo means to be neglected, when it can be done without
danger os disturbing the peace, for in this case alone did he
intend that it should be enforced3 and we are also to observe
his other injunction, to sorbear one another in love, endeavour·

XIV. 'Phe remaining part oi discipline, which is not strictly
included in the power os the keys, consists in this-that the
pastore, according to the necessity os the times, should exhort
the people either to sastings or solemn supplications, or to other
exercises of humility, repentance, and saith, os which the word
ol God prescribes neither the time, the extent, nor the form,
but leaves all this to the judgment ol the Church. The ob-
servation ol these things, also, which are highly useful, was
always practised by the ancient Church srom the days of the
apostles; though the apostles themselves were not the lirat .
authors of thern, but derived the example from the law and the
propheta. For there we find, that whenever any important
business occurred, the people were assembled‚ supplicatione
commanded, and lasting enjoined. The apostles, therefore, fol·
lowed what was not new to the people of God, and what they
foresaw would be usesul. The sama reasoning is applicable to
other exercises by which the people may be excited to duty, or
preserved in obedience. Examples abound in the sacred history,
which it is unnecessary to enumerate. 'I'he conclusion to be
deduced from the whole is, that whenever a controversy arises
respecting religion, which requires to be decided by acouneil or
ecclesiasticul judgment; whenever a minister is to be chosen,
in short, whenever any thing os difficulty or great importance
is transacting ; and also when any tokens os the Divine wratb
are discovered, such as samiae, pestilence, or war ; -it is a pioua,
custom, and beneficiat in all ages, sor the pastors to exhort tha
people to public sasts and extraordinary prayers. If the testimo·
nias which may be adduced from the Old Testament be reject·
ed, as inapplicable to the Christian church, it is evident that the
apostles practised the same. Respecting prayers, however, l sup·
