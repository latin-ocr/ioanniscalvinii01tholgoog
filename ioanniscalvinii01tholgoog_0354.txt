Church, it will be said, is different. lreply-Paul has ob⁴
viated this objection in another place, when he says that “saith
cometh by hearing, and hearing, by the word of God.'’(o) But
is it be the word os God alone upon which saith is suspended,
towards which it looks, and on which it relies, l ask what is
“ there lest sor the word of the whole world? Here it will be
impossible for any man to hesitare who has really known what
saith is. For it ought to rest on such firm ground as to stand
invirrcible and undismayed in oppositiou to Satan, to all the rna·
chinations os hell, and to all the assaults of the world. Thia
stability we shall find in the word ol God alone. Besides
the reason which we are here required to consider iaot' uui-
versal application-that God denies to man the right of pro·
mulgating any new article os saith, in order that he alone may
be our Master in spiritual doctrine, as he alone is true beyond
all possibility os deceiviug or being deceived. This reasonia
no less applicabis to the whole Ohurch thau to every individual
believer.

the Church, be compared with that which has novior soma

exposa the shamesul methods in which they have exercised
their tyranny: Ι shall only state the doctrine, which they de·
send in the present age, not only by their writiugs, but also by
lire arrd sword. As they take it for granted that a universal
council is the true representative os the Church, having assumed
thie principle, they at once determine, aa beyond all doubt,

that such councils are under the immediate directiou of the .

Holy Spirit, and therefore cannot err. Now, as they them·
solves influeuce the councils, arrd even constitute them, tho
fact is, that they assrune to themselves all that they contenti
sor os belonging to the councils They wish our saith, there-
fore, to stand or sall at their pleasure, that whatever they may
have determined on one side or thember, may be implicitly
received byour mindsaa fullydecided3 sothatif tbeyapproveof
any thing, we must approveof the same without any hesitation3
aud if they condemn any thing, we must unite in the condem·

arrd in contemptos the word os God, they fabricate doctrines
which, for no other reason thau this, they require to be be-
lieved. For they eckuowledge uo man as a Christian, who
