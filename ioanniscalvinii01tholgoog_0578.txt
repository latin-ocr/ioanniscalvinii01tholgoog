that the reprobate are excluded from the participation of it.
The following passage of Cyril also shows him to have besu
of the same opinion: “As when any one pours melted wax
upon other wax, the whole will be mingled together into one
mass, so it is necessary to any persou's reception of the body
and blood of Christ, for him to be united with Christ, so
that Christ may be found in him, and he in Christ.'' These
words,l think, sufficiently prove, that those who eat the
body of Christ merely in a sacramental way are deprived of
the true and real participatiou of it, as the body itself cannot
be separated from its efficacious power 3 and yet that this is no
impeachment of the truth of the promises of God, who still
continues to send us rain from heaven, though rocks and stenes
imbibe none of the moisture.

the carnal adoration which has baeu introduced into the sa·
crement by the perverse temarity of some, who reasoned in this
manner: If the body be there, consequently the soul and the
Divinity are there together with the body, for they cannot bc
separated from it; therefore Christ ought to be adored there.
lu the first place, what will they do, if we refuse to admit what
they call conmemorare? For, however they may urge the
absurdity of separating the soul and the Divinity from the body,
what man in his sensas can be persuaded that the body of
Christ is Christ? They consider it, indeed, as fully demon-
strated by their arguments. But as Christ speaks distinctly
of his body and blood, without specifying the nature of the
presence, how can they establish what they wish by that
which is itself doubtful? What then? lf their consciences
happen to be exercised with any peculiar affliction, will they
not, with all their syllogisms, be coufounded and overwhelrned;
when they shall perceive themselves to be destitute of the
certain word of God, which furnishes the only support for our
souis when they are called to give an account, and without
which they sink in a momeut3 when they shall refiect that the
doctrine and examples of the apostles are against thern, and that
they arc themselves the sole authors of their error? To such
reflections will be added other sentiments of compunction, and
those by no means inconsiderable. What! was it a thing of
no consequence to adore God in this form, without any such
thing being enjoined upon us? In a case where the true wor-
ship of God was concerned, ought that to have been so lightly
undertaken, which not a word in the Scripture could be found
to sanction? But if, with becoming humility, they had kept
all their thoughts in subjection to the word of God, they would
ceumnly have listened to what Christ said, “ Toka, eat, driuk,''
and would have obeyed this command, which enjoins the sacra-
