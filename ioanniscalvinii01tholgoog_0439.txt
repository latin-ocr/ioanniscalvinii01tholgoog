XXVIII. Theresore, whenever the advocates 61 this modern
tyranny attempt 16 defend their celibacy with the pretext of
antiquity, we shall not 1611 to reply, that they ought 16 restore
the ancient chastity in their priests, to remove all adulterare
and fornicatore, not 16 suffer those, whom they forbid the vir·
16666 and chaste society 61 a wife, to abendon themselves with
impunity to every kind 61 debauchery, to revive the obsoleta
discipline by which all indecencies may be repressed, 16 11611161
the Ghurch 116111 this flagitious turpitude, by which it hes been
so long deformed. When they shall have granted this, 11 will
still be necessary to admonish them not to impose that as ne-
cessary, which, being free in itsels, depende on the convenience
61 the Ghurch. Yet I heve not made these observatione from
66 opinion that we ought on any condition to admit those
canons thch impose the obligation 61 celibaey on the clergy,
but to enable the more judicious 16 perceive the effrontery 61
661 adversaries in alleging the authority 61 antiquity to bring
disgrace 66 holy marriage in priests. With respect to the fa·
thera, whose writings 616 extant, with the exception 61 Jerome,
they have not so malignantly detracted from the virtue 61 mar·
riage, when they have been expressing their own sentimenta.
We shall content ourselves with 6116 testimony 61 Chrysostom,
because he, who was 6 principal admirer 61 virginity, cannot

be supposed 16 have been more lavish than others in commen·

dation 61 marriage. He says, “The first degree 61 chastity is
pure virginity; the second is faithful marriage. Theresore the
second species 61 virginity 16 the chaste love 61 matrimony.”

Ir is a thing truly to be deplored, that the Church, after its
liberty had 116611 purchased by the inestimable price 61 the
blood 61 Christ, should have been so oppressed with a cruel
tyranny, and almost overwhelmed with an immense mass 61
traditions; but 1116 general Irenzy 61 individuale shows that it
has not been without the justest cause, that God has permitted
so much 1ο be done by Satan and his ministers. For it was
not sufficient 161 1116111 16 neglect the command 61 Christ, and
to endure every burden imposed on them by salse teachers,
1111666 they respectively added some 61 their own, and so 611611
themselves deeper in pits 61 their own digging. 'I'his was the
