blessing, we are obnoxious to the curse which is dcnounced on
all transgressors. For the Lord promises nothing, except to
the perfect observers of his law, os which description not one
can be found. The consequence then is, that all mankind are
proved by the law to be obnoxious to the curse and wrath of
God, in order to be saved from which, they need deliverance
from the power of the law, and emancipation from its servi·
tude ; not a carnal liberty, which would seducc us from obedi-
ence to the law, invite to all kinds of licentiousness, break
down the barriers of inordinate desire, and give the reins to
every lawless passion; buta spiritual liberty, which will con·
sole and elevate a distressed and dejected conscience, showing
it to be delivered from the curse and condemnation under
which it was held by the law. This liberation from subjection
to the law, and manumission, (if l may use the terrm) wa
attain, when we apprehend by saith the mercy os God in
Christ, by which we are assured of the remissiones sins, by
the sense of which the law penetrated us with compunction
and remorsa.

ll. For this reason all the promises of the law would be
ineffectual and vain, unless we were assisted by the goodness
of God in the gospel. For the condition of a perfect obe·
dience to the law, on which they depend, and in consequence
of which alone they are to be fulfilled, will never be performed.
Now, the Lord affords this assistance, not by leaving a part of
righteousness in our works, and supplying part from his mercy,
but by appointing Christ alone for the completiones right·
eousness. For the apostle, having said that he and other Jews,
“ knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the law,
believed in Christ,'’ adds as a reason, not that they might be
assisted to obtain a complete righteousness by saith in Christ,
but “that they might be justified by the saith of Christ, and
not by the works os the law.’' (a) Is the faithful pass from the
law to saith, to find righteousness in the latter, which they
perceive to be wanting in the former, they certainly renounce
the righteousness of the law. Theresore let whosocver will
now amplify the rewards which are said to await the observer
of the law ; only let him remark, that our depravity prevents
us from receiving any benefit from thern, till we have obtained
· by faith another righteousness. Thus David, after having
mentioned the reward which the Lord has prepared for his
servants, immediately proceeds to the acknowledgmcnt of sins,
by which it is annulled. In the nineteenth psalm, lihewise‚ he
magnificently celebrates the benefits of the law; but imme·
diately exclaims, “Who can understand his errore? cleanse
