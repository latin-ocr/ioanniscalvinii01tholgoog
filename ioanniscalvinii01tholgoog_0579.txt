ment to be taken, not to be adored. Those who, as the Lord
has commanded, receive it without adoration, are assured that
they do not deviate from the Divine command; and such an
assurance is the best satisfaction we can have in any thing iu
which we engage. They have the example os the apostles, os
whom we read, not that they prostrated themselves in adora·
tion, but that, as they were sitting at the table, they took, and
did eat. They have the practice os the apostolic Church, iu
which Luke states that the communiones believers consisted,
not in adoration,butin “the breaking ol bread.‘'(e) They
have the apostolic doctrine with which Paul instructed tha
Church os the Corinthiam, accompanying it with this declara·
tion: “I have received os the Lord that which also l delivered
unto you.''

XXXVI. (illl these things lead the picus reader to consider
how unsase it is, in matters of such importance, to leave the
pure word os God sor the reveries of our own brains Tha
'remarks which have already been made, ought to relieve our
minds from every difficulty on this subject. For, in order to

What, then, shall we deny it to be a superstitious worship,
when meu prostrate themselves besore a picce os bread, to
adore Christ in it? There is no doubt that the Council os Nice
intended to guard against this evil, when it prohibited Christiana
from having their attention humbly fixed on the visible signs.
And this was the only reason sor that custom in the ancient
Church, that, before the consecration, one os the descons should,
withan audible voice, admonish the people to have their bearts
above. The Scripture itsels, also, in addition to the particular
account which it gives us os the ascension os Christ, by which
he removed his corporeal presence from the view and society of
men, in order to divest us os every carnal idea respecting him,
whenever it mentions him, calls us to lift our minds upwards,
and to secli sor him seated “at the right hand of God.” (g)
According to this rule, it was our duty to adore him spiritually
in the glory of heaven, rather than to invent such a dangerons

os God. Wheresore, those who have invented the adoration os
the sacrament, have not only dreamed it os themselves, without
the sanction of the scripture, in which not the least mention
