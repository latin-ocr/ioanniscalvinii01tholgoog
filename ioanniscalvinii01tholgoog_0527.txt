have been instructed, are to be baptized, and subjoins a pro-

Is there even a single syllable in the whole discourse respect·
ing infants? What kind of argumentation, then, is that with
which they assail us? Persona of adult age are to be instruct-
ed, in order that they may believe before they are to be bap-
tized3 therefore it is unlawful to administer baptism to insonte.
It will be impossible for them, with all their ingenuity, to
prove any thing from this passage, except that the gospel is
first to be preached to those who are capable of hearing it, be-
fore they are baptized3 for it relates to no others. Let thern
raise an obstacle from this, if they can, to exclude infanta from
baptism.

will show the absurdity of them bya very plain similitude.
'Phe apostle says, “ that if any would not work, neither should

years of age.'' That is ture indeed 3 but the reason is obvious;
because he theu intended to lay a solid foundation sor baptism
by his preachiug, or rather to establish that which had a little
before been laid by John. Intending, therefore, to institute
baptism in his doctrine, iu order to conciliate the greater au·
thority to his institution, he sanctified it in his own body, and
that at the point of time which he knew to he most proper,
namely, when he was about to eommeuce his ministry. ln
short, they can prove nothing else from this circumstance, ex·
cept that baptism derived its origin and commaneament from
the preachiug of the gospel. lf they approve of fixing the
thirtieth year, why do they not observa it, but admit every
one to baptism as soon as he is, iu their jndgment, sufficiently
qualified for it? And even Servatus, one of their leaders,
