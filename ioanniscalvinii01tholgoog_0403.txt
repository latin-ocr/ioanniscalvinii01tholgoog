judgment of an ignoble and despised Church might otherwise be
treated with contempt by presumptuous and proud men. And
that the readers may not be embarrassed by the circumstance
of Christ having used the same words to express different things,
it will be usesul to solve this difficulty. There are two places
which speak os binding and loosing. One is in the sixteenth
chapter of Matthew, where Christ, aster having promised Peter
that he would “give '³ him “the keys of the kingdom of
heaven,” (r) immediately adds, “ Whatsoever thou shalt bind
on earth, shall 88 bound in heaven ; and whatsoever thou shalt
loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.'’ In these words he
means precisely the same as he intends in other language
recorded by John, when, being about to send forth his disciples
to preach, aster having “ breathed on them,’' he said, “ Whose
soever sins ye remit, they are remitted unto them; and whose
soever sins ye retain, they are retained.’'(s) 1 shall offer an
interpretation of this pamage, without any subtlety, violence,
or perversion, but natural, suitable,and obvious. 'I'his command
respecting the remission and retention os sins, and the promise
made to Peter respecting binding and loosing, ought to be
wholly referred to the ministry os the word, which when our
Lord committed to the apostles, he at the same time invested
them with the power of binding and loosing. For what is the
sum of the gospel, but that, being all slaves ol' sin and death,
we are loosed and delivered by the redemption which is in

ν Christ Jesus, and that those who never receive or acknowledge

Christ as their Deliverer and Redeemer, are condemned and
sentenced to eternal chains? When the [ord delivered this
embassy to his apostles, to 88 convcyed to 811 uations, in order
to evince it to be his, and to have proceeded from him, he
honoured it with this remarkable testimony, and that sor the
the particular confirmation both of the apostlcs themselves,
and os all those to whom it was to be announced. It was os
importance, that the apostlcs should have 8 strong and constant
assurance os their preaching; which they were not only to
undertake and execute amidst immense labours, cares, troubles,
and dangers, but were at length to seal with their blood. 'I'hat
they might know this ministry not to 88 vain or ineffectual,
but full of poweer energy, it was os importance sor them, in
circumstances os such great anxiety, difficulty, and danger, to
be persuaded that they were employed in the work of God;
amidst all the hostility and opposition os the whole world, to

know that God was ou their side, and though Christ, the
Authorof their doctrine, was not present to their view on earth,
to be certain that he was in heaven to confirm the truth of the
