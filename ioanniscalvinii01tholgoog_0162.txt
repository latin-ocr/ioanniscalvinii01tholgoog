capcd him, if there had been any solidity in it; bnt well know·
ing the impossibility of God’s foreseeing any good in man, ex-
cept what he had first determined to bestow by the benefit of
his electiori, he resorts not to the preposterous order of placing
good works before their cause. We have the apostle’s author-
ity that the salvation of believers is founded solely on the de·
cision of Divine election, and that that favour is not procured
by worlrs, but proceeds from gratuitous calling. We have also
a lively exhibition of this truth in a particular example. Jacob
and Esau are brothers, begotten of the same parents, still cn·
closed in the same womb, not yet brought sorth into light3
there is in all respecta a perfect equality between them; yet
the judgment of God concerning thern is different For he
talrcs one, and rejects the other. The primogenitum was the
only thing that gave one a right of priority to the other. But
that also is passed by, and on the younger is bestowed what is
refused to the elder. Iu other instances, also, God appears
always to have treated primogenitura with designed and deci·
ded contempt, to cut off from the flesh all occasion of beasting.
He rejects lshmael, and favours isaac. He degrades Manasseh,
and honours Ephraim.

VI. If it be objected, that from these inferior and inconsider-
able benefitS, it must not be concluded respecting the life to
c'onre, that he who has been raised to the honour of primogeni-
tura is therefore to be considered as adopted to the inheritance
of heaven, -for there are many who spare not Paul, as though
in his citation of Scripture testimonies he had perverted them
from their genuine meaning,-I answer as before, that the
apostle has neither erred through inadvertency, nor wilfully
perverted testimonies of Scripture. But he saw, what they
cannot bear to consider, that God intended by an earthly
symbol to declare the spiritual electiones Jacob, which other-
wise lay concealed behind his inaccessiblc tribunal. For
unless the primogeniture granted him had reference to the
future world, it was a vain and ridiculous kind of blessing,
which produced him nothing but various afflictione and ad·
versities‚ grievous exile, numerous cares, and bitter sorrows.
Discerning, beyond all doubt, that God’s external blessing was
an indication of the spiritual and permanent blessing he had
prepared for his servant in his kingdom, Paul hesitated not to
argue from the formeria proof of the latter. lt must also be
remembered, that to the land of Oanaan was annexed the
pledge of the celestial residence; so that it ought not to
be doubted that Jacob was ingrafted with angele into the body
of Christ, that he might be a partaker of the same life. While
Esau is rejected, therefore, Jacob is elected, and distinguished
from him by God’s predestination, without any difference of
