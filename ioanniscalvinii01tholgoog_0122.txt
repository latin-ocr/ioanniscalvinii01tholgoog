God, whose temples our bodies ought to be, will accede to thc
desires of our souls. For he did not intend to deny the expedi-
enoy of praying also in other places ; but shows that prayer is a
kind of secret thing, which lies principally in the heart, and re
quires a tranquillity of mind undisturbed by all cares. lt was
not without reason, therefore, that the Lord himself, when he
would engage inan unusual vehemenoe of devotion, retired to
some solitary place, t‘ar from the tumult of men; but with aview
to admonish us by his own example, that we ought not to neglect
these helps, by which our hearts, naturally too inconstsnt, are
more intensely fixed on the devotional exercise. But notwith-
standing, as he did not refrain from praying even in the rnidst
of a multitude, if at any time the occasion required it, so we,
in all places where it may be necessary, should “lift up holy
hands.'' (a) And so it is to be conoluded, that whoever
refuses to pray in the solemn assembly of the saints, knows

nothing of private prayer, either solitary or domestic. And '

again, that he who negleots solitary and private prayer, how
sedulously soever he may frequent the public assemblies, only
forms there such aa are mere wind, because he pays more de·
ference to the opinion of men than to the secret judgment of
God. ln the mean time, that the common prayers of the
Churoh might not sinlr into contempt, God anciently distin·
guished them by splendid titles, especially when he called the
temple a “house of prayer.” (b) For by this expression he
taught both that the duty of prayer is a principal part of his
worship, and that the temple had been erected as a standard for
believers, in order that they might engage in it with one
consent. 'l'here was also added a remarkable promise: “ Praise
waiteth for thee, Ο God, in Sion3 and unto thee shall the vow
be performed;” (c) in which words the Psalmist informs us
that the prayers of the Church are never in vain, because the
Lord supplies his people with perpetual matter of praise and
joy. But though the legal shadows have ceased, yet since it
has been the Divina will by this ceremony to maintain a unity
of faith among us also, the same promise undoubtedly belongs
to us, Christ having confirmed it with his own mouth, aad
Paul having represented it as perpetually valid.

XXX. Now, as God in his word commands believers to
unite in common prayers, so also it is necessary that public
temples be appointed for performing them3 where they who
refuso to join with the people of God in their devotioris, have
no just reason for abusing this pretext, that they enter into
their closets, in obedienoe to the Divina mandate. < For he who
promises to grant whatever shall be implored by two or three
