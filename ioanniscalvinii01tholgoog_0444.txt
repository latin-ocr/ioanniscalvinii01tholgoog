the same kind in the ancient peace-offerings‚ which used to be
vowed by pious kings and generals, enteriug on just wars, to
be offered in case they should obtain the victory; or by per-
sons labouring under more than common difficulty, in case the
Lord would deliver them. Thus we are to understand alr
those places in the Psalms which spealr of vows.(ft) Vows
of this kind may also be now used among us, whenever God
delivers us from any great calamity, from a severe disease, or
from any other danger. For on such occasions, it is not in-
consistent with the duty of a pious man to consecrate to God
some oblation that he has vowed, merely as a solemn token of
grateful acknowledgment‚ that he may not appear unthanltful
for his goodness. 'Phe nature of the second species of vows
will sufficiently appear from only ona familiar example. lf a
person has fallen into any crime through the vice of intem·
perance, nothing preventa him from eorrecting that vice by
a temporary renunciation of all delicacies, aud enforcing this
abstinence by a vow, to lay himself under the stronger obli·
gation. Yet 1 impose no perpetual law on those who have
been guilty of such an offence; Ι only point out what they are
at liberty to da, if they think that such a vow would be useful
to them. 1 consider a vow of this ltind, therefore, as lawful,
hut, at the same time, aa left to the free ehoice of every
individual.

V. Vows which regard the future, as l have observed, have
for their object, partly to render us more cautious of danger,
partly to stimulate us to the performance of duty. For ex· ,
ample; aperson perceives himself to be so prone to a certain
vice, that, in something not otherwise evil, he cannot restrain
himself from falling into sin, he will commit no absurdity, if
he should deny himself the use of that thing for a season
by a vow. lf any one be convinced that this or the other
ornament of dress is dangerous to him, and yet feel excessivo
desire for it, he cannot do better than restrain himself by im-
posinga necessity of abstinence, in order to free himself from
all hesitation So, if any one be forgetful or negligent of
the necessary duties of piety‚ why may henot arouse his
memory, and shake off his negligence by the imposition of a
vow? ln both cases, I confess, there isan appearance ot pupil-
age, but, considered as helps of infirmity, such vows may
be used with advantage by the inexperienccd and imperfect.
Vows, therefore, which respect one of these ends, especially
those relating to external things, wa shall affirm to be lawful, if
they be supported by the approbation of God, if they be
suitable to our calling, and if they be limited by the ability of
grace which God has given us.
