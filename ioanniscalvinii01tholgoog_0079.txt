gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour; that the truth
of the gospel might continue with you.” (d) We also are
under ‚the necessity os vindiceting onr liberty, ιι it be endan-
gered in weak consciences by the iniquitous requisitione of
false apostles. We must at all times study oharity, and keep
in view the edification os our neighbour. “All things (says
Paul) are lawful for me, but all things are not expedient: all
things are lawful sor me, but all things edify not. let no ntan
seek his own, but every man another’s.” (e) Nothing can be
plainer than this rule, that our liberty should be used, is it con·
duces to our neighbour's edification; but that ιι it be not benc·
ficial to our neighbour, it should be abridged. There arc some,
who pretend to imitate the prudence os Paul in refraiuiug from
the exercise os liberty, while they are doing any thing but ex·
eroising the duties of charity. For to promote their own tran·
quillity, they wish all mentiones liberty to be buried; whereas
it is no less advantageous to our neighbours sometimes to use
our liberty to their benefit and edification, than et other times
to moderate it for their accommodatiora. But a pious man con-
siders this liberty in external things as granted himin order
that he may be the better prepared for all the duties of charity.

XIII. But whatever I have udvauced respecting the avoid-
ance os offences, 1 wish to be referred to indifferent and un·
important things; sor necessary duties must not be omitted
through sear of any offence: as our liberty should be subject
fo charity, so oharity itself ought to be subservieut to the purity
of saith. It becomes us, indeed, to have regard to charity3 but
we must not offend God for the love ot‘ our neighbour. We
cannot approve the intemperance of those who do nothing but in
a tumultuous manner, and who pret‘er violent measures to le·
nient ones. Nor must we listen to those, who, while they show
themselves the leaders in a thousand speeies os irnpiety, pretend
that they are obliged to act in such a manner, that they may give
no offence to their neighbours; as though they are not at the
same time fortisying the consciences of their neighbours in sin;
especially since they are always sticking in the sarne mire
without any hope os deliverance. And whether their neighbour
isto be instructed by doctrine or by example, they maintain
that he ought to be fed with milk, though they are iut‘ooting
him with the worst and most pernicious notions. Paul tells
the Corinthians, ‘⁸ I have fed you with milk; '’ (s ) but is the
Popish mass had been then introduced among thern, would he
have united in that pretended sacrifice in order to seed them
with milk? Certainly not; for milk is not poison. They are
guilty os falsehood, therefore, in saying that they seed those
