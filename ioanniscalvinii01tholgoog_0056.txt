be found correspondent tc the purity of God; but knowing
that their sincerity, justice, simplicity, and purity, are pleasing
and acceptable to God, in comparison witlr the mallee, wicked·
ness, standand iniquity of their enemim, they are not afraid to
invoke Him to judgc between them. Thus, when David said
to Saul, “ The [ord render to every man his righteousness and
his faithfulness,” (o) he did not mean that the Lord should ex·
amine every individua] by himself, and reward him according
to his ments, but he called the Lord to witness the greatness
of his innocence in compariscn with the iniquity of Saul. Nor
did Paul, when he gloried iu having “ the testimony of '³ his
“conscience'’ that he had conducted himself in the Chumh
‘⁴ with simplicity and godly sincerity,’' (w) intend to rely on this
before G0d3 but the calumniosos the impious constrained him
to oppcse all their slanderous aspersions by asserting his fidelity
and probity, which he knew to be acceptable to the Divina good·
nese. For we know what lre says in another place: “ I am con·
scious to myself of nothing ; yet am l not hereby justified.” (a)
Because, indeed, he was certain, that the judgment of God far
transcendcd the narrow comprehension of man. However,
therefore, the picus moy vindicate their innocence against the
hypocrisy of the impious, by invoking God to be their witness
and judge, yet in their concerns with God alone, they all with
one voice exclaim, ‘⁴ lf thou, Lord, shouldst mark iniquities, Ο
Lord, who shall stand? ” (y) Again: “ Enter not into judg·
ment with thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living be
justified.'' (z) And, diffidentes their own works, they gladly
sing, “Thy leving-kindness is better than life.” (a)

XV. There are likewlse other passages, similar to the prece·
ding, on which some person may yet insist. Solomon says,
“The just man walketh ln his integrity.” (b) Again: “ In thc
way of righteonsness there is life; and in the pathway thereof
there is no death.” (c) Thus also Ezeklel declares, that he who
“dcth that which is lawful and right, shall surely live.” (d)
We neither deny nor obscure any cf these. But let one of the
sons of Adam produce such an integrity. If no one can, they

must either perish from the presence of God, or fiee to the
asylum of mercy. Nor do we deny, that to believers their
integrity, however imperfect, is a step toward immortality.
But what is the cause of this, unless it he that when the Lord
has admitted any persons into the covenant of his grace, he
does not scrutinize their works according to their intrinslc
merit, bnt embraces them with paternal benignity? By this
