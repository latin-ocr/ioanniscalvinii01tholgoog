to furnish it with fresh supplies, so the flesh of Christ is like
a rich and urexhaustible sountain, which receives the lit'e flow-
ing from the Divinity, and conveys it to us. Now, who does
uot see that a participation os the body and blood os Christ is
necessary to all who aspira to heavenly lise? This is implied
iu those passages of the apostle, that the Church is the body
of Christ, and his sulness ; (q) that he is “ the head, from whom
the whole body, joined together and compacted by that which
every joint supplieth, maketh increase of the body; ” (r) that
our bodies are “the members of Christ 3 '³ (s) things which we
know can no otherwise be affected than by his entire union
both of body aud spirit with us. But that most intimate sel·
lowship, by which we are united with his flesh, the apostle has
illustrated iu a still more striking representation, when he says,
“ We 'are members of his body, of hisflesh, and os his boues.'’ (t)
At length, to declare the subject to be above all description, he
concludes hisdiscourse by exclairning, “This is a great mys·
tery.”(u) It would be extreme stupidity, therefore, to ac·
knowledge no communion os believers with the body and
blood os the Lord, which the apostle declares to be so great,
that he would rather admira than express it.

X. We conclude, that cur souls are fed by the flcsh and
blood of Christ, just as our corporeal lise is preserved and sus·
taiued by bread aud wine. For otherwise there would be uo
suitableness in the analogy oi the sign, if our souls did uot find
their foed in Christ; which cannot be the case unless Christ
truly becomes oue with us, aud refreshes us by the eating of
his fiesh and the drinking of his blood. 'Phough it appears
incredible sor the dash os Christ, from such an immense local
distance, to reach us, so asto become our foed, we should re·
member how much the secret power of the Holy Spirit trau·
scends all our sensas, aud what solly it is to apply any measure
os ours to his immensity. Let our saith receive, therefore,
what our understanding is not able to comprehend, that the
Spirit really unites things which are separated by local dis·
tance. Now, that holy participation of his flesh and blood, by
which Christ communicatas his life to us, just as is be actually
penetrated every part os our frama, iu the sacred supper he also
testifies and seals; and that not by the exhibition ol a vain or
ineffectual sign, but by the exertion of the energy of his Spirit,
by which he accomplishes that which he promises. And the
thing signified be exhibita and offers to all who come to that
spiritual banquet; though it is advantagcously enjoyed by be-
lievers alone, who receive such great goodness with true saith
