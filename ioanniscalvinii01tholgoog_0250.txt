body, that they cannot stand before God without remissiori of
sins. Secondly, that this benefit belongs to the Church3 so
that we cannot enjoy it unless we continue in its communion.
Thirdly, that it is dispensed to us by the ministers and pastore
of the Charch, either in the preaching of the gospel, or in the
administrationes the sacramente, and that this is the principal
exorciso of the power of the keys, which the Lord has con·
ferred on the society of believers. Let every one of us, there·
fore, consider it as his duty, not to seek remissiones sins any
where but where the Lord has placed it. Of public reconcilia·
tion, which is a branch of discipline, we shall speak in its
prpeilpllaceffl as those fanatic spirits, of whoml spoke, en·
deavour to rob the Church of this sole anchor ofsalvation, our
consciences ought to be still more strongly fortified against
such a pestilent opinion. 'Phe Novatians disturbed the ancient
Churches with this tenet; but the present age also has wit·
nessed some of the Anabaptists, who resemble the Novatians
by falling into the same follies. For they imagine that by
baptism tlh people os God are regenerated to a pure and an·
gelic life, which cannot be contaminated by any impurities of
the fiesh. And is any one be guilty of sin after baptism, they
leave him no prospect of escaping the inexorable judgment of
God. ln short, they encourage no hope of pardon in any one
who sins after having received the grace of God; because they
acknowledge no other remissiori of sins than that by which we
are first regenerated. Now, though there is no falsehood more
clearly refuted in the Scriptura than this, yet because its advo·
cates find persons to submit to their impositione, as Novatus
sonnerly had numerous sollowers, let us briefly show how very
pernicious their error is both to themselves and to others. In
the first place, when the saints obey the command of the Lord
by a daily repetition of this prayer, “forgive us our debts,²’ (q)
they certainly confess themselves to be sinners. Nor do they
pray in vain, for our Lord has not enjoined the use of any
petitions, but such as he designed to grant. And after he
had declared that the whole¹ prayer would be heard by the
Father, he confirmed this absolution by a special promise.
What do we want more? 'Phe Lord requires from the saints
a confession of sins, and that daily as long as they live, and he
promises them pardon. What presumption is it either to essert
that they are exempt from sin, or, if they have fallen, to exclude
them frorn all grace! To whom does he enjoin us to grant for·
giveness seventy times seven times? Is it not to our brethrenl
And what was the design of this injunction, but that we might
