we dissuade them from this patience. For it truly behoves
Christiane to be a people, as it were, formed to bear injurias
and reproaches, exposed to the iniquity, impostureS, and ridi·
cule of the worst of mankind, and not only so, but they ought
to be patient under all these evils; that is to say, so calm and
composed in their miride, that, after having suffered one affliction,
they may prepare themselves for another, expecting nothing·
all their lifetime but to bear a perpetual cross. At the same
time, they are required to bless and pray for them from whom
they receive corsos, to do good to them from whom they ex·
perience iujuries,(e) and to aim at that which constitutes
their only victory, to “overcome evil with good.’' ( s ) With
this disposition they will not demand “au eye for au eye, and
a tooth for a tooth,'' as the Pharisees taught their disciples to
desire revenge3 but, as we are instructed by Christ, they will
suffer injuries in their persons and property in such a manner
as to be ready to forgive them as soon as they are com·
mitted. (g) Yet this equanimity and moderatiori will be no
obstacle, but that, without any breach of friendship towards
their enemies, they may avail themselves of the assistance of
the magistrate for the preservation of their property; or, from
zeal for the public good, may bring a pestilent offender to
justice, though they know he can only be punished with
death. For it is very correctly explained by Augustine, that
the eud of all these precepts is, “that a just and pious man
should be ready to bear with patience the wickedness of those
whom he desires to become good; rather in order that the
number of the good may increase, not that with similar
wickedness he may himself join the number of the evil, and
in the next place, that they relate to the internal affection of
the heart more than to the external actions; in order that in
the secrecy of our mindswe may feel patience and benevolence,
but in our outward conduct may do that which we see tends to
the advantage of those to whom we ought to feel benevolent
affectious.’¹

XXI. 'I'he objection which is frequently alleged, that law·
suits are universally condemned by Paul, has no foundation in
truth. (h) lt may be easily understood from his words, that
in the Church of the Corinthiaus there was an immoderate
rage sor litigation, so that they exposed the gospel of Christ,
and all the religion which they professed, to the cavils aud re-
proaches of the rmpious. The first thing which Paul repre·
hended m them was, that the intemperancc of their dissensione
brought the gospel mto discredit among unbelievers. And the
