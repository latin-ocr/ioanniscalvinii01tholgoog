It is a Gordian lrnot, which it is better to cut asunder than to

XII. Now, when they find themselves stripped of the word
of God, and of every probable argument, they resort to their
usual pretext, that it is every ancient usage, and confirmed by
the consent of many ages. Though this allegation were true,
it would not at all serve their cause. A sacrament is not from
earth, but from heaveu; not of men, but of God alone. If
they wish their confirmation to be regarded as a sacrament,
they must prove God to be the Author of it. But why do
they allege antiquity, seeing that the ancient fathers, when·
ever they mean to express themselves with strict propriety,
nowhere enumerate more than two sacraments? lf it were
necessary to fortify our faith by the authority of men, we
have an impregrrable fortress, that those ceremonies, which our
adversaries falsely pretend to be sacramente, were never ae-
knowledged as sacraments by the ancients. The fathers speak
of imposition of hands; but do they call it a sacrament? Au·
gustine explicitly affirms that it is no other than prayer. Here
let therh not oppose me with their foolish distinctions, that
Augustino applied this remark to impositiones hands, not as
practised in confirmation, but as used for the purpose of healing,
or of reconciliation. The book is extant, and is in many hands
lfl pervert the passage to any meaning different from that of
Augustine himself, Ι am content to submit to their severest
censure and contempt. For he is speaking of schismatics,
who returned to the unity of the Church3 and denies that they
have any need of the reiteration of baptism, for that imposition
of hands was sufficient, in order that, by the bond of peace, the
Lord might give them his Holy spirit. And as it might
appear unreasorrable to repeat imposition os hands rather than
baptism, he shows the difference. “ For what,” he sayS, “is
impositiones hands, but prayer over a man? '' And that this
was his meaning, is evideut from another passage, where he
says “We lay hands upon reclaimed heretics, for the union
of charity, which is the priucipal gift of the Holy Spirit, and
without which whatever else may be holy in man is unavailing
to salvation.”

Xlll. 1 sincercly wish that we retained the custom‚ which 1
have stated was practised among the ancients before this
abortive image of a sacrament made its appearance. For it
was not such a confirmation as the Rornanists pretend, which
cannot be mentioned without injury to baptism, but a cate·
chetieal exercise, in which children or youths used to deliver
au account of their faith iu the presence of the Ohurch. Now,
it would be the best mode of catechetical instruction, ifa
