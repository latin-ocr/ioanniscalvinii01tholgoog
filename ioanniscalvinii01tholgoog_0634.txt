obtrude upon us as a proos os their sacrament. Beadles, at
their consecration, receive the lreys of the Churcb, as a sign
that the eustody os it is committed to thern. Readers are
presented with the Holy Bible. 'I'o exorcists are given tbe
forms os exorcisms to be used over catechumenis and maniacs.
Aeolothists receive their tapers and dagons. These are the
ceremonies which, is we believe them, contain such secret
virtue as to be, not only signs and tokens, but even causes, os
an invisible grace. For, according to their definition, all this is
assumed when they insist on their being numbered among the
sacramenta But, to conclude in a sew words, I maintain it to
be absurd for canonists and scholastic theologues to give the title
os sacraments to these, which they themselves call lesser orders ,·
since, even according to their own confession, they were un· ,
known to the primitive Ohurch, and were invented many years
after. But, as sacraments contain some promises ot' God, they
cannot be instituted by men or angels, but by God alone, whose
prerogative it is to give the promise.

XXVIII. There romain three orders, which they call greater
orders; os which subdeaconry, they say, was transferred to this
class aster the number of the lesser orders began to increase. As
they tbinlr that they bave a testimony sor these from the word
os God, they peculiarly denominate thern, sor the sake of ho·
nour, holy orders. But we must now examine how perversely
they abuse the Divine appointments os God in their own vin-
dIcation. We will begin with the order os presbyters, or priests.
For by these two names they signily one thing3 and these are
the appellations which they apply to those whose office, they say,
it is, to offer the sacrifice of the body and blood of Christ upon
the altar, to say prayers and to pronounce benedictinus on the
gifts of God. Theresore, at their ordination, they receive a
chalice, with the patine and host, as symbols of the power
committed to thern to offer expiatory sacrifices to God; and
their hands are anointed with oil, as a symbol to show that
they are invested with power to consecrate. The ceremonias
we shall notice hereafter. Os the thing itself, I affirm, that it
isso far from havIng a syllable ol the Divine word to support
it, that it was impossible for them to bave introduced a viler
corruption os the order instituted by God. In the first place, it
ought to be taken for granted, as we have shown in the pre-
ceding chapter, on the Papal Mass, that great injury is done
to Christ by all those who call themselves priests to offer sa-
crifices os expiation. He was constituted and consecrated by the
Father, with an oath, a priest after the order os Melchisedec,
without end, and without a successor. He once offered a sa-
crifice os eternal expiation and reconciliation; and now, having
entered into the sanctuary of heaven, intercedas sor us. ln him
