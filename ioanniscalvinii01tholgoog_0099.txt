that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.’' (z) For
what is more amiable or attractive than for God to bear this
character, which assures us, that nothing is more agreeable to
his nature, than to grant the requests of humble suppliants?
Hence the Psalmist concludes that the way is open, not toa
few only, but to all men; because he addresses ell in these
words: “ Call upon me in the day of trouble: 1 will deliver
thee, and thou shalt glorify me.'' (a) According to this rule,
David, in order to obtain his request, pleads the promise that
had been giren him: “ Thou, Ο Lord‚ hast revealed to thy
serrant-3 therefore heth thy servant found in his heart to
pray.'’ (b) Whence we conclude that he would have been
fcarful, had he not been encouraged by the promise. So in
· another place he furnishes himself with this general doctrine:
“ He will fulli} the desire of them that fear him.'’ (c) In the
Psalms we may likewise observa the connection of prayer as it
were interrupted, and sudden transitions made, sometimes to
the power of God, sometimes to his gooduess, and sometimes
to tho truth of his promises. lt might appear as though David
mutilated his prayers by an unseasoneble introduction of such
passages: but believers know by experience, that the ardour
of devotion languishes, unless it be supported by fresh supplies;
and therefore a meditation on the nature and the word of God
is far from being useless in the midst of our prayers. Let us
not hesitate, then, to follow the example of David in the intro-
duction of topics calculated to reanimato languid souis with
new vrgour. -

with promises so exceedingly sweet; that the generality of
men, wandering through a labyrinth of errore, nster having sor·
sakan the fonntuin of living wetere, prefer hewing out for thern·
selves cisterns incapable of containing any water, to embracing
the free offers of Dirine gooduess. “The name of the Lord
(says solomon) is a strong tower: the righteous runneth into
it, and is safe.''(d) And Joel, after having predicted the
speedy approach of a dreadful destmction, adds this memorable
sentence: “Whosoever shell call on the name of the Lord‚
shall be delivered;” (e) which we know properly refers to
the course os the gospel. Scarcely one man in a hundred is
induced to advancc to meet tho Lord. He proclaims by lsaiah‚
“Before they call, 1 will answer; and while they aro yet
speaking, I will hear.'’ (s) And in another place he dignifies
the whole (ihurch in general with the same honour3 as it be·
