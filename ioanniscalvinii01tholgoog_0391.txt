making lawa to entangle their consciences with bondsge. But

XXI. Nor does the cause of our adversaries darive much
advantage from their attempt to excuse their own tyranny, by
alleging the example of tha apostles. The apostles, they say,
arrd elders of the primitive Ghurch, passed a decree without
the command of Christ, enjoiniog all the Gentiles to “abstain
from meats offered to idols, and from blood, and from things
straugled.'’(s) lf this was lawful for thern, why may it not
be lawiul ior their successors, whenever circumstances require,
to imitate their conduct? I sineerely wish they would imitate
them in other things as well as in this. For Ι deny that the
apostles, on that occasion, instituted or decreed any thing new,
as it is easy to prove bya sufficient reason. For when Peter
had declared in that assembly, that to “ put a yoke upon the
neck of the disciples ” would be to “ tempt God,'' (t) he would
have contradicted his own opinion, if he had afterwards coo·
sented to the imposition of any yoke. Yet there wasa yoke
imwsed, if the apostles decreed, from their own authority,
that the Gentiles should he prohibited “from meets offered to
idols, and from blood, aud from things strangled.” There still
tamaius some difficulty, that nevertheless they seem to prohibit
them. But this will be easily solved, if we more closely ex·
amine the meaning of the decree itself; of which the first
point iu order aud principal in importance is, that the Gentiles

were to be left in possession of their liberty, and not to be dis· ⁴

turbed or troubled about the observance of the law. So far it
is completely in our favour. The exception which immediately
follows is not anew law made by the apostles, hut the Divina
aud eterual command for thy preservatiou of charity inviolate ;
nor does it diminish a tittle of that liberty: ir only admonishes
the Gentiles how they ought to accommodate themselves to
their hrethreu, to avoid offending them by an ahuse of their
liberty. The second point, therefore, is, that the Gentiles were
to use a harmless liberty, and without offence to their hrethren.
If it be still objected, that they prescrihe a certain direction, Ι
reply, that as far as was expedient for that period, they point
out and specify the things in which the Gentiles were liahle to
give offence to their hrethren, that they might refrain from
them3 yet they add nothing new of their own to the eternal
law of God, by which offences against our hrethren are pro-

hihited.
