is a considerable difference3 such as we observa, also, between
similar signs under the Old Testament. Circumcision, which
is known to correspond to our baptism, was destined for infante.
'Phe passover, which has now been succeeded by the sacred
supper, did not admit guests of all descriptions promiscuously,
but was rightly eaten only by those who were of sufficient age
to be able to inquire into its signification. If our opponente
had a grain of sound sense, would they shut their eyes against
a thing so clear and obvious?

XXXI. Though Ι am sorry to burden my readers with
such an accumulation of reverias, yet it will be worth while to
refute the specious arguments adduced in this controversy by
Servetus, one of the most eminent of the Anabaptists, and
even the chief glory of that sect. 1. He pretends that the
symbols appointed by Christ, as they are perfect, require also
those who receive thern to be perfect, or persons capable of
perfectiori. But the answer is easy-that the perfectiori of
baptism reaches even unto death, and cannot with propriety
be restricted to one instant of time. l observe, also, that it is
foolish to expecta man on the first day to attain perfectiori,
towards which baptism invites us to, proceed, by continual
advances, as long as we live. 2. He objects, that the symbols
of Christ were instituted aa memoriale, that every one may
remember that he has been buried with Christ. 1 answer,
that what he has framed from his own head requires no refuta·
tion 3 and that he applies to baptism what the lauguage of
Paul shows to be peculiar to the sacred supper, namely, that
every one should examine himself ; but that nothing like this
is any where said of baptism; from which we conclude, that
though, by reason of their age, infants are not capable of exami-
nation, it is nevertheless right to baptiza thern. 3. He ad-
duces the declaration of Christ, that “he that believeth not
the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abideth on
him ; '’ (g) and concludes that infants, who are incapeble of
believing, remain in their condemnation. Ianswer, that in this
passage Christ is not speaking of the general guilt in which all
the descendants of Adam are involved, but only threatening the
despisers of the gospel, who proudly and obstinately reject the
grace which is offered to them; and this has nothing to do
with infanta. I likewise oppose econtrary argument; all
those whom Christ blesses are exempted from the curse of
Adam and the wrath of uod, and as it is known that infants
were blessed by him, it follows that they are exempted from
death. He falsely alleges, as a passage of Scriptura, that
“ whosoever is born of the Spirit heareth the voice of the
