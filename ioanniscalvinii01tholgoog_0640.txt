loveth himself ; even as the Lord the Church.’' Now, to
declare how Christ has loved the Church, even as himself,
and how he has made himself one with the Church his sponse,
Paul applies to him what Moses relates Adam to have spoken
of himself. For when Eve was brought into his presence,
knowing her to have been formed out of his side, he said,
“ This is bone of my bones, and flesh os my flesh.'’ (w) Paul
testifies that all this has been spiritually fulfilled in Christ and
us, when he says, “We are members of his body, of his fiesh,
and of his bones,'’ and consequently “one flesh '' with him.
At length he concludes with an exclamation, “This is a great
mystery;'’ and, that no one might be deceivcd by an ambi·
gnity of language, he expressly states, that he intends not the
conjugal union of man and woman, but the spiritual marriage
of Christ and his Church: “1 speak concerning Christ and the
Church.” And, indeed, it is a great mystery that Christ has suf·
fereda rib to be taken from him, of which we might be formed:
that is to say, though he was strong, he voluntarily became
wealr, that we might be strengthened with his might3 so that
now we “ live, yet not'’ we, “but Christ liveth in'’ us.(a)

XXXVI. They have been deceivcd by the word sacrament
in the Vulgate version. But was it reasonable that the whole
Church should suffer the punishment of their ignorance? Paul
has used the word μυστηριον, mysterp -a word which the trans-
lator might have retained, mysterium being not unfamiliar to
Latin ears, or he might have rendered it arcanam, secret; he
preferred, however, to use the word sacramentum, sacra·
ment, but in the same sense in which Paul has used the Greek
word μυστηριον, mystery. Now, let thern go and clamorously rail
against the critical knowledge of languages, through ignorance
of which they have so long been most shamefully deceivcd in
a thing so easy and obvious to every one. But why do they
so strenuously insist on the word sacrament in this one passage,
and pass it over in so many others without the least notice?
For that translator has used it twice in the First Epistle to
Timothy, (y) and in another place in this Epistle to the Ephe-
sianS, (z) and in every other case where the word mystery
occurs. Let this oversight, however, be forgiven them; liars
ought, at least, to have good memorias. For, after having
dignified matrimony with the title of a sacrament, what brain-

less versatility is it for them to stigmatize it with the charac- Α

ters of impurity, pollution, and carnal defilement! What an
absurdity is it to exclude priests from a sacrament! If they
deny that they are interdicted from the sacrament, but only
from the conjugal intercourse, 1 shall not be satisfied with this
evasion. For they inculcata that the conjugal intercourse
