affection to such an indulgent Father, in whom they discover
such care of their posterity on their account. Nor shall 1 regard
an objection, if it should be urged, that the mere promise of
God ought to be sufficient to assurc us of the salvation of our
children3 since God, who knows our wealrness‚ and has been
pleased in this instance to indulge it, has decided otherwise.
let those, therefore, who embrace the promise of God that he
will perpetuata his mercy to their offspring, consider it their
duty to present them to the Church to be signed with the
symbol of marey, and thereby to animate their minds to
strongcr confidence‚ when they actually see the covenant of
the Lord engraven on the bodies of their children. 'Pha
children also receive some advantage from their baptism, their
ingrafting into the body of the Church being a more peculiar
recornmcndation of them to the other membcrs; and afterwards,
when they grow to years of maturity‚ it operatas upon thern as
a powerful stimulus to a serious attention to the worship of
God, by whom they were accepted as his children by tha
solemn symbol of adoption, before they were capable of
knowing him as their Father. Finally‚ we ought to be alanned
by the vengeance which God threatens to inflict, if any one
disdains to mark his son with the symbol of the covenant3 for
the contempt os that symbol involves the rejection and abjura-
tion of the grace which it presents.

X. Lat ns now discuss the arguments with which soma
violent disputants continue to impngn this holy institution of
God. In the first place, finding themselves very hardly pressed
and exceedingly embarrassed by the similarity of baptism and
circumcision, they labour to establish a considerable difference
between these two signs, that one may appear to have nothing
in common with the other. For they affirm, first, that dif-
ferent things are signified3 secondly, that the covenant is en·
tirely different3 and thirdly, that the children are mentioned
in a different manner. But when they endeavour to prove the
first point, they allege that circumcision was a figure of mor·
tification, and not of baptism; which we most readily grant,
soritis an excellent argument in our favour. We urge no
other proof of our sentiment, than that baptism and circum-
cision are equally signs of mortification. Hence we conclude,
that baptism was introduced in the place of circumcision, and
represents to us the very same thing which that formerly did
to the Jews. In asserting a difference of the covenant, with
what presumption and absurdity do they corrupt the Scriptura,
and that not in asingle passage, but without leaving any part of
it secure from their perversions. For they represent tha carnali·
ty of the Jews to be such, as to give them a greater resem-

blance to brutes than to rational bcings ; contending thau
