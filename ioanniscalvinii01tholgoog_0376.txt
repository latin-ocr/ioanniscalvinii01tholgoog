ample to his brethren, but brings his conscience into a state of·
guilt before God. 'l'he case 01 things, in themselves indiffer-
ent, stands not on the same ground3 for we ought to abstain
from whatever is likely to give offence, but with a free con-
science. Thus Paul speaks of meat consecrated to idols: “ 11
any man say unto you, This is offered in sacrifice to idols, eat
not sor his sake, and for conscience' sake. Conscience, I say,
not thine own, but 01 the other.’' (p) A faithful man, who,
after previous admonition, should eat such meat, would be guilty
01 sin. But though such abstinence is enjoined on him by God
as necessary on account os his brother, he still retains his liberty
of conscience. We sce how this law, while it binds the ex·
ternal act, leaves the conscience free.

V. Let us now return to human laws. Iftheyare designed
10 introduce any scruple into our minds, as though the obser·
vance of them were essentially necessary, we asscrt, that they
are unreasonable impositione on the conscience. For our con·
scienoes have todo, not with rnen, but with God alone. And
this is the meaning of the well known distinction, maintained
in the schools, between abumari tribunal and the court 01 con·
science. When the whole world was enveloped in the thick·
est shades of ignorancc, this little spark of light still remained
unextinguished, so that they acknowledged the conscience 01
man to be superior to all human judgments. 11 is true that
what they confessed in one word, they afterwards overturned
in fact; yet it was the will of God that even at that time there
should remain some testimony in favour 01 Christian liberty,
10 rescae the conscience from the tyranny 01 men. But we
have not yet solved the difficulty which arises from the lan-
guage 01 Paul. For if princes are 10 be obeyed, “ not only for
wrath, but also for conscience’ sake,'' (q) it seems 10 follow,
that the laws 01 princes have dominion over the conscience.
11 this be true, the same must be affirmed of the laws 01 the
Church. 1 reply, ln the first place, it is necessary 10 distin·
guish between the genus and the species. For the con·
science is not affected by every particular law3 yet we are
bound by the general command of God, which establishes the
authority 01 magistrates. And this is the hinge upon which
Paul’s argument turns, that magistrates are 10 be honoured be-
cause they are “ordained 01 God.’' (r) At the same time he
is far from insinuating that the laws enacted by them have any
thing 10 do with the internal govemment 01 the soul; for he
every where extols the service of God and the spiritual rule 01 a
holy life, above all the statutes and decrees of men. A second
consideration worthy of notice, which is a consequence of the
