these two, and not only neither admit nor acknowledge any
other at present, but neither desire nor expect any other to the
end of the world. For as the Jews, beside the ordinary sacra·
ments given to thern, had also several others, differing accord·
ing to the varying circumstances of different periodS, such as
the manna, the water issuing frorn the rock, the brazen serpent,
and the like, they were admonished by this variation not to
rest in such figures, which were of short duration, but to
expect from God something better, which should undergo no
change and corne to no end. But our case is very different:
to us Christ has been revealed, “iu whom are hid all the
treasures of wisdom and knowledge,''(c) in such abundance
and profusion, that to hope or desire any new accession to
these treasures would really be to displease God, and provoke
his wrath against us. We must hunger after Christ, we must
seek, contemplate, aud leam him alone, till the dawning of that
great day, when our Lord will fully manifest the glory of his
kingdom, and reveal himself to us, so that “we shall sce him
as he is.’' (d) And for this reason, the dispensatiou under
which we live is designated in the Scriptures as “the last
time,'' “these last times,'' “the last days‚” (e) that no one
may deceive himself with a vain expectation of any new
doctrine or revelation. For “ God, who at sundry times and in
divers manners spake in time past unto the fathers by the
prophets, hath, in these last days, spoken unto us by his
Son‚'' (s) who alone is able to “ reveal the Father‚” (g) and
who, indeed, “ hath declared him '’ (t) fully, asseras is neces·
sary for our happiness, while “now we see '' him “through a
glass darkly.’' (i) As men are not left at liberty to institute
new sacraments in the Church of God, so it were to be wished
that as little as possible of human invention should be mixed
with those which have been instituted by God, Foras wine is
diluted and lost by an infusion of water, and as awhole mass of
meal contracts acidity from asprinkling of leaven, so the purity of
Divine mysteries is only polluted when man makes any addition
of his own. And yet we see, as the sacraments are observed
in the present day, how very far they have degenerated from
their original purity. There is every where an excess of page·
antries, ceremonias, and gesticulations; but no consideration
or mention of the word of God, without which even the
sacraments themselves cease to be sacraments? And the very
ceremonies which have been instituted by God are not to be
discerned among such a multitude of others, by which they are
