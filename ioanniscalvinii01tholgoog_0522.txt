cura xva] camarina necrororv. 513

Lord does not exclude infants from the hope of mercy, but
rather assuras them of it, why shall we refuse them the sign,
which is so far inferior to the thing signified? Wherefore, the
argument which they urge against us, we retort upon them·
selves; infants are favoured with remissiou of sins, -therefore
they ought not to be deprived of the sign. They also adduce
that passage where the Lord is said to “ cleanse the Church
with the washing of water by the word.” (m) But no text
could be quoted more conclusive against their err0r3 it fumishes
an obvious confirmation of our sentiment. If it be the will os
Christ that the ablution, with which he cleanses his Church, be
testified by baptism, it appears unreasonable that its testimony
should be wanting in infants, who are justly considered as part
of the Church, since they aro called heirs of the kingdom of
heaven. For Paul speaks of the whole Church, when he de·
scribes it as cleansed with the washing of water. And, on the

same principle, from that passage where he says that we are all ’

baptized into the body of Christ, (n) we conclude that infants,
whom he numbers among his members, ought to be baptized,
that they may not be separated from his body. See with what
violence, and with what variety of weapons, they attack the
bulwarks of our saith!

XXllI. They proceed, in the next place, to the practice of
the apostolic age, in which no one is found to have been ad·
mitted to baptism without a previous profession of saith and
repentance. F'or in answer to those who “were pricked in
their hesit, and said, What shall we do? Peter said unto them,'’
first, “repent,'’ and then “be baptized for the remissiori of
sius.’' (o) In like manner Philip, when the eunuch requested
to be baptized, replied, “ If thou believest with all thine heart,
thou mayest.” (p) Hence they think themselves justified in
concluding, that baptism ought never to be administered to any
person without being preceded by saith and repentance. But
is we adopt this reasoning, the first of these passages, which
makes no mention of saith, will evince the sufficiency of re·
pentance alone: the second, where repentance is not required,
will prove that saith alone is sufficient. Isuppose they will

reply that one passage is elucidated by the other, and that
therefore they ought to be connected together. I also contend
that other places ought to be consulted, which may contributa
to the solution os this difficulty. For there are many passages
of Scripture, the sense of which depends on the circumstances
connected with them. 'l'his is exemplified in the cases now
under consideration. For the persons addressed by Peter and
