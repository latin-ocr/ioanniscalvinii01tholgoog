comprehends all the children of God, among whom they also
are numbered. To this may be referred the exhortation which
Paul gives believers oi his age, “that men pray every where,
lifting up holy hands without wrath ; '' (d) because by admo·
nishing them, that discord shuts the gate against prayers, he ad·
vises them unanimously to unite all their petitione together.

this is the same as 11 he had been said to be possessed ο1 an
incomprehensible essence, infinite magnitude or sublimity,
irresistible power, and unlimited immortality. But when we
hear this, our thoughts must be raised to a higher elevation
when God is mentioned; that we may not entertain any ter-
restrial or carnal imaginatione concerning him, that we may
not measure him by our diminutive proportions, or judge os
his will by our affectione. We should likewise be encouraged

to place the most implicit reliance on him, by whose providence
and power we understand both heaven and earth to be governed.
