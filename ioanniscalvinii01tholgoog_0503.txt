PAEDOBAPTISM PERFOETLY CONSIS'I'ENT Wl'ffl ΤΗΒ ΙΝΒΤῘΤῸἩΟΝ
Οἳ CHRIST ANB THE nawen Οἳ vlia More.

As some turbulent spirits in the present age have raised
frerce disputes, which still continue to agitate the Church, on
the subject of infant baptism, 1 cannot refrain from adding
some observations with aview to repress their violence. lf
any one should think this chapter extended to an immoderate
length, Ι would request him to consider, that purity of doctrine
in a capital point, and the peace of the Ohurch, ought to
be of too much importancc in our estimation for us to feel
any thing tedious which may condoce to the restoration of
both. Ι shall also study to make this discussion of as much
use as possible to a further elucidation of the mystery of bap-
tism. They attack infant baptism ‚with an argument which

, carries with it an appearance of great plausibility, asserting

that it is not founded on any institutiones Christ, but was
first introduced by the presumption and corrupt curiosity of man,
and afterwards received with foolish and inconsiderate facility.
For a sacrament rests on no authority, unless it stands on the
certain foundation of the word of God. But what if, on a full
examination of the subject, it shall appear that thiais afalae
and groundless calumny on the hely ordinance of the Lord?
Let us, therefore, inquire into its first origin. And if it shall
be found to have been a mere invention of human presump-
tion, we ought to renounce it, and regulata the true observance
of baptism solely by the will of God. But if it shall be proved
to be sanctioned by his undoubted authority, it behoves us to
beware lest, by opposing the holy institutione of God, we
offer an insult to their Author himself.

11. In the first place, it is a principle sufficiently known,
and acknowledged by all believers, that the right consideration
of sacramental signs consists not merely in the external cere·
menies, but that it chiefly depende on the promise and the
spiritual mysteries which the Lord has appointed those cere-
monias to represent. Whoever, therefore, wishes to be fully
informed of the meaning of baptism, and what baptism is,
must not fix his attention on the clement and the outward
spectacla, but must rather elevate his thoughts to the promises
of God which are offered to us in it, and to those internal aud
spiritual things which it represents to us. He who discovers
these things, hes attained the solid truth and all the substance
