God3 but it is preposterous to represent onc as dependent on
the other. When we attribute foreknowledge to God, we mean
that all things have ever been, and perpetually remain, before
his eyes, so that to his knowledge nothing is future 00 past, but ι
011 things are present ; and present in such a manner, that he

does not merely conceive of them from ideas formed in his
mind, as things remembered by us appear present to our minds,
bnt really beholds and sees thern as if actually placed before him.
And this forekuowledge extends to the whole world, and to all
the creaturas. Predestination we call the etemal decree of
God, by which he has detennined in himself, what he would
have to become of every individual 01 mankind. For they are
not all created with a similar destiny; but 0100001 1110 10 fore·
ordained for some, and eternal damnation for others. Every
0000, therefore‚being created for one 00 1100 011000 01 these ends,
we say, he is predestinated either to life or 10 death. This God
has not only testified in particular personS, but has given a
specimen of it in the whole posterity of Abraham, which should
evidently show the future condition 01 every nation to depend
upon his decision. “ When the Most High divided the nations,
when he separated the sons of Adam, the Lord's portion was
his people, Jacob was the lot 01 his inheritance.''(l) The
separation is before the eyes of all: in the person of Abraham,
as in the dry trunlr 01 0 1000, 000 people is peculiarly chosen
to the rejection 01 others: no reason for this appears, except
that Moses, to deprive their posterity 01 011 occasion 01 glorying,
teaches thern that their exaltationis whollyfrom God's gra-
tuitous love. He assigns this reason for their deliverance, that
“ he loved their fathers, and chose their seed after them.” (m)
More fully in another chapter: “The Lord did 001 set his love
upon you, nor choose you, because you were more in number
than any people; but because the Lord loved you.'’ (n) He
frequently repeats the same admonition: “ Behold, the heaven
is the Lord’s thy God, the earth also, with all that therein 10.
Only the Lord had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and
he chose their seed after them.”(o) In another place, sancti·
fication is enjoined upon thern, because they were chosen 10
be a peculiar people. ( p) And again, elsewhere, love is asserted
to be the cause of their protection. lt is declared by the united
voice 01 1100 faithful, “ He hath chosen our inheritance for us,
the excellency of Jacob, whom he loved.''(q) For the gifts
conferred on thern by God, they all ascribe to gratuitous love,
not only from a consciousness that these were not obtained by
any merit of theirs, but 100000 conviction, that the holy patri·
