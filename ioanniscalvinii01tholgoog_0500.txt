instituted hy God, would shine with the greatest lustre, tmen·
cumbered with any extraneous corruptions. But whether the
person who is baptized be wholly immersed, and whether
thrice or once, or whether water be only poured or sprinkled
upon him, is of no importance; Charches ought to be left at
liberty, in this respect, to act according to the difference of
countries. Tne very word baptizo, however, signifies to im-
merse ; and it is certain that immersion was the practice os the
ancient Church.

XX. It is also necessary to state, that it is not right for
private persons to take upon themselves the administration of
baptism; for this, as well as the administrationes the Lord’s
supper, is a part of the public ministry of the Charch. Christ
never commanded women, or men in general, to baptize; he
gave this charge to those whom he had appointed to be apos·
tles. And when he enjoined his disciples, in the celebration
os the supper, to do as they had seen done by him when he
executed the office os a legitimate dispenset, he intended, with·
out doubt, that they should imitate his example. The custom,
which has been received and practised for many ages past, and
almost from the primitive times oi the Church, for baptism to
be performed by laymen, in cases where death was apprehend-
ed, and no minister was present in time, it appears to me im·
possible to defend by any good reason. Indeed, tlte ancients
themselves, who either observed or tolerated this custom, were
not certain whether it was right or not. Augustino betrays
this uncertainty, when he says, “And if a layman, compelled
by necessity, has given baptism, I know not whether any one
may piously affirm that it ought to be repeated. For if it bs
done without the constraint os necessity, it is a usurpation of
an office which belongs to another; but is necessity obliges, it
is either no offense, or a venial one.'' Respecting women, it
was decreed without any exception, in the Council of Carthage,
that they should not presume to baptizo at all, on pain os ex-
communication. Bnt it is alleged, there is danger, lest a child,
who is siclr and dies without baptism, should be deprived
ot‘ the grace of regeneration. This 1 can by no means admit.
God pronounces that he adopts our insants as his children,
before they are born, when he promises that he will be a uod
to us, and to our seed asterus This promise includes their
salvation. Nor will any dare to offer such an insult to God as
to deny the sufficierrcy of his promise to insure its own accom-
plishment. The mischievous consequences of that ill-stated
notion, that baptism is necessary to salvation, are overlooked
by persons in general, and therefore they are less cuncus, far

the reception of an opinion, that all who happen to die vi
baptism are lost, makes our condition worse a*
