entirely different from the processes of civil courts, their succes-
sors have erected an ordinary jurisdiction. ln a subsequent pe·
riod, when cities and countries were oppressed with various dis·
tresses, they had recourse to the patronage of their bishops, that
they might be protected by their influence; succeeding bishops,
by wonderful artifice, os protectors have made themselves lords.
Nor can it be denied, that the principal acquisitions they have
made, have been effectcd by saction and violence. The princes,
who voluntarily invested the bishops with jurisdiction, were
actuated to this by various motives. But though their indul·
genoe may have exhibited some appearance of piety, yet their
preposterous liberality was by no means adapted to promote the
benefit os the Ghurch‚ tho ancient and genuine discipline os
which they thereby corrupted, or rather, to say the tmth, utterly
annihilated. But those bishops who have abusedsuch kindness
ol princes to their own profit, have sufficiently evinced, by this
one specimen, that they were in reality no bishops at all. For
ifthey had possessed a particle os the apostolic spirit, they
would unquestionably have answered, in the language of Paul,
that “the weapons ot' our warsare are not carnal, but '’ (a)
spiritual. Instead os this, hurried away with a blind cupidity,
they have ruined themselves, and their successors, and the
Olrurch.

said os himself, that he was not constituted a judge between
two persons, the servant and disciple ought not to think it any
disgrace not to be judge of all men.” Bemard is speaking here
of civil judgments, lor he adds, addressing the pope, “ There·

sor the former, and not sor the latter, that you have received
the keys os the kingdom os heaven. For which appears to you
