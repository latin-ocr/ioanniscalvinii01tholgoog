imbecility, they solicitously confine themselves within the
limita os the word of God3 lest, it' they prooeed 'iar by their
own sense, they should wander from the right way, in conse·
quence os being not yet fully enlightened by that spirit, by
whose teaching alone truth is distinguished from salsehood.
For all consess with Paul, that they have not yet attained the
mark; therefore they rather press on towards daily improve-
ment, than boast of perfectiori. (t)

XII. But they will object, that whatever is partially attributed
to every one os the saints, completely and periectly belongs tq
the whole Churoh. Notwithstanding the plausibility os this
position, yet l deny it tn be true. I admit that God distributas
the gista of his Spirit by measure to every member of his
Church‚ in such a manner that nothing necessary is wanting to
the whole body, when those gifts are bestowed in common.
But the riches oi the Churoh are always such as to be very far
from that consummate perfectiori boasted by our adversaries. Yet
the Church is not left destitute in any respect, but that it always
has what is sufficient3 sor the Lord knows what its necessity
requires. But to restrain it within the bonnds 01¹ humility and
picus modesty, he bestows no more than he sees to be expedi·
ent. Here,l know, they are accustomed to object, that the
Church has been “cleansed by the washing of water by the
word, that he might present it to himself a glorious Church,
not having spot, or wrinlrle, or any such thing, but that it
should be holy and without blemish ; '’(u) and that sor this
reason it is called “the pillar and ground of the truth.”(v)
But the former of these passages rather indicates what Christ is
daily performing in his Church, than any thing that he has already
accomplished. Foris he is daily sanctiiying, purifying, polish·

to their sandlification. How² vain and visionarygis it to imagini
the Church already perfeetly holy and immaculate, while all
its members are the subjeets of corruption and impurity! It is
true that the Church is sanctified by Christ, but it is only the
commencement of their sanctification that is sesnin the present
state3 the end and perfect completion os it will be when Christ,
the Holy of Holies, shall fill it trnly and entirely with his
holiness. lt is likewise true that its spots and wrinkles are
effaced, but in such a manner that they are in a daily course
of obliteratinn, till Christ at his coming shall entirely efface all
that remains. For, mles we admit this, we mustos necessity
assert, with the Pelagians, that the righteousness of believers is
perfect in the present lile, and with the Cathari and Donatista,
