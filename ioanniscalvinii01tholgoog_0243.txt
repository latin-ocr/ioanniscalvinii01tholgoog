whole gospel would be annihilated3 where the greces of God
were made subservierit to ambition, instead os charity ; where
many things were conducted without decency and order; (z)
aod is there still remained a Church, because the ministry os
the word arrd sacramente was not rejected—who can refusa
the name os a Church to those who cannot be charged witha
tenth part of those crimes? And those who display such vio·
leuce and severity against the Churches os the present age,l
ask, how would they have conducted themselves towards the
Galaticus, who almost entirely deserted the gospel, but among
whom, nevertheless, the same apostle found Churches l (o)
XV. They object that Paul bitterly reproves the Corinthians
for admitting an atrocioris offender into their company, aud
follows this reproot' with a general declaration, that witha
man ol scandalous lise it is not lawsul even to eat (b) Here
