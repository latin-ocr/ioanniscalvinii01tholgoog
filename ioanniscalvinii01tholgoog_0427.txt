Christ. The same conduct is pursued in the present day by
the Anabaptists, who, aclmowledging no congregation to belong
to Christ, unless it be, in all respecta, conspicuous sor angelic
perfectiori, under the pretext of acal, destroy all edification.

“Such persons,'' says Augustino, “not actuated by hatred
against the iniquity os others, but stimulatcd by fondness for
their own disputes, desire either wholly to pervert, orat least
to divide the wealr multitude by insuaring thern with their
boastful pretensions; inflated with pride, infuriated with obsti·
nacy, insidious with calumnias, turbulent with seditione, that
their destitution of the light os truth may not be detectcd, they
conceal themselves under the eovert of a rigorous severity;
and those things which the scripture commanda to be done
for the correction of the saults of our brothton, without viola·
ting the sincerity of love, or disturbing the unity of peace, but
with the moderatiori of ¹a remedial process, they abuse, to an
occasion of dissension and to the sacrilege of schism. Thus
Satan transforma himself into an angel os light, when from
just severity bo takes occasion to persuade mento inhuman
cruelty, with no other object than to corrupt and break the
bond of peace and unity; by the preservation of which among
Christiana, all his power to injure them is weakcned, his insi·
dious snares are broken, and his schemas for their ruiu corne to

XIll. There is one thing which this father particularly
recommends-that if the contagion of any sin has infectcd a

which are combined in strict discipline. “For schemas of
separation,'' he says, “ are pemicious and sacrilegious, because
they proceed from pride and impiety, and disturb the good who
are wealr, more than they correct the wicked who are bold.’'
And what he here prescribes to others, he faithfully followed
himself. For writing to Aurelius, bishop of Carthago, he com·
plained that drunlrenness, which isso severely condemned in
the Scriptura, prevailed with imprmity in Africa, and persuaded
him to endeavour to remedy it by calling a provincial council.
He immediately adds, “I believe these things are suppressed
not by harshncss, severity, or imperiousness, but by teaching
rather than commanding, by admonitions rather than by mc·
naoes. For this is the conduct to be pursued witha multitude
of offenders 3 but severity is to be exercised against the sins of
a few.'' Yet he does not mean that bishops should connive or
be silent, because they cannot inflict severe punishments for
public crimes, as he afterwards explains ; but hc means that the
correction should be tempered with such moderatiori, as to be
saltitary rather than injurious to the body. And therefore he at
length concludes in the following manner: “thrcfore,also,
