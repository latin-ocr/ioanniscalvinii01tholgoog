extreme os presumption, that they neither sear God nor re·
gard men?

XXVIII. But let us suppose the impiety os those pontiffs,
whom I have mentioned, to be concealed, because they have
not published it by sermons or by writIngs, but only betrayed
it ln their chambers and at their tables, or at least within the
walls os their palaces. But is they wish to establish this privi-
lege to which they pretend, they must expungo srorn the
number os the pontiffs John the Twentysecond, who publicly
maintained that souls are mortal, and that they perish together
with the bodies till the day os resurrection. And to show
that the whole see, with its principal pillars, was then entirely
overturned, not one os the cardinale resisted this capital err0r;
but the university os Paris urged the king os France to compel
the pope to a retraction. 'Phe king interdicted his subjecte

· srom all communion with him, unless he should speedily re·
pent; and he caused this to be proclaimed, in the usual manner,
by a herald. Compelled by necessity, the pontiff abjured his
error. 'I'his example renders it unnecessary sor me to dispute
any longer against the assertiou os our adversaries, that the see
os Rome and ita pontills cannot err respecting the saith, besam
Christ said to Peter, “I have prayed sor thee, that thy saith
sail not.” John certainly sell srorn the true saith in so dis-
gracesul amanner, that he might surnish to posterity a signal
proos, that those who succeed Peterin his bishopric are not all
Petere. The argument itsels, however, is too puerile to need
any answer. For is they are determined to apply to Peter’t
successore every thing that was said to Peter, it will sollow
that they are ull Satans, because the Lord also said to Peter,
“Get thee behiud nte, Satan ; thou art an offence nuto me.'’ (d)
It will be as easy sorus to retort this passage against them, as
it is sor thern to object the other against us.

XXIX. But it affords me no pleasure to contend with them
iu such sooleries, and therefore I return srom the digression.
'Po confine Christ, and the Holy Spirit, and the Ohurcb, to one
particular place, so that whoever presides there, even though
he be a davil, rnust, nevertheless,be deamed the vicar os Christ,
and the head os the Church, because that place was formerly
the see os Peter, I maintain to be not only impious and dis·
honourable to Christ, but altogether absurd and repugnant to
common sense. 'Phe Roman pontifis sora long time have
either been totally indifferent to religion, or have shown them-
selves its greatest enemies. They are nomore made the viears
os Christ, theresore, by the see which they occnpy, than an
idol is to be taken sor God, because it is placed iu his temple.
