watchmen in the Ohurch, that is any one perish in ignorance
through their negligence, he will require the blood ol such a
person at their hands. (r) What Paul says os himself, belongs
to them all: “ Woe is unto me, if l preach not the gospel,” be·
cause “a dispensation os the gospel is committed unto me.’' (s)
Lastly, what the apostles did for the whole world, that every
individual pastor ought to do sor his flock to which he is
appointed.

Vll. While we assign to them all respectively their distinct
Ohurches, yet we do not deny thatapastor, who isconnected with
one Ohurch, may assist others, either when any disputes arise,
which may require his presence, or when his advice is aslred
upon any difficult subject. But because, in order to preserve
the peace of the Church, there is a necessity for such aregulation
as shall clearly define to every one what duty he has to do, lest
they should all sall iuto disorder, run hither and thither in un·
certainty without any call, and all resort to one place3 and lest
those who feel more solicitude sor their personal accommodatiora
than sor the edification of the Ohumh, should, without any
cause but their own caprice, leave the Churches destitute,-
this distribution ought as far as possible to be generally observed,
that every one may be content with his own limits, and not
invade the province ot' another. Nor is this au invention of
men, but an institution os God himself. For we read that Paul
and Barnabas “ordained elders in the respective Ohurches of
Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch 3 ” (t) and Paul himself directed
Titus to “ordain elders in every city.” (v) So in other pas-
sages he mentions “the bishops at Philippi‚” (w) and Archippus,
the bishop os the Colossinus. (a) And a remarkable speech
of his is preserved by Lulre, addressed to “the elders of the
Church os Ephesus.'' (y) Whoever, therefore, has undertaken
the govemment and charge of one Ghurch, let him know that
he is bound to this law os the Divine call; not that he is fixed
to his station so as never to be permitted to leave it in a regular
and orderly manner, is the public benefit should require it ; but
he who has been called to one place, ought never to think either
of departing from his situation, or relinquishing the office alto·
gether, from any motive os personal convenience or advantage.
But if it be expedient that hc should remove to another station,
he ought not to attempt this on his own private opinion, but to
be guided by public authority. ’
