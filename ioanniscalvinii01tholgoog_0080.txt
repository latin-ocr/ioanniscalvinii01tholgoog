whom they cruelly murder under the appearance of such flat·
teries. But admitting that such dissimulationis to be approved
for a time, how long will they feed their children with the
same milk? For if they never grow, so as to be able to bear
even some light meat, it is a clear proof that they were never
fed with milk. 1 arn prevented from pushing this con·
troversy with them any further at present, by two reasons—
first, because their absurdities scarcely deserve a refutation,
being justly despised by all men of sound understauding;
secondly, having done this at large in particular treatises, 1 arn
unwilling to travel the same ground over again. Only let the
readers remember, that with whatever offences Satan and the
world may endeavour to divert us from the ordinances of God,
or to retard our pursuit of what he enjoins‚ yet we must never·
thelcss strenuously advance; and moreover, that whatever dan·
gers threaten us, we are not at liberty to deviate even a harr’s
breadth from his command, and that it is not lawful under any
pretext to attempt any thing but what he permita

XIV. Now, since the consciences of believers,'being pri·
vileged with the liberty which we have described, have been
delivered by the favour of Christ from all necessary obliga·
tion to the observance of those things in which the Lord has
been pleased they should be left free, we conclude that they
are exempt from all human authority. For it is not right that
Christ should lose the acknowledgments due to such kindness,
or our consciences the benefit of it. Neither is that to be
accountcd a trivial thing, which we see cost Christ so much3
which he estirnated not with gold or silver, but with his own
blood3 (n) so that Paul hesitates not to assert, that his death is
rendered vain, if we suffer our souls to be in subjection to men. (o)
For his sole object in some chapters of his Epistle to the Gala·
tians is to prove that Christ is obscured, or rather abolished, with
respect to us, unless our consciences continue in their liberty;
from which they are certainly fallen, if they cau be insnared in

the bonds of lawa and ordinances at the pleasure of men. (p)
But as it isa subject highly worthy of being understood, so it

needs a more diffuse and perspicuous explanation. For as soon
as aword is mentioned conceming the abrogation of human
establishmentS, great tumults are excited, partly by seditious
persons, partly by cavillers; as though all obcdienee of men
were at once subverted and destroyed.

XV. To prevent any one from falling into this error, let us
therefore consider, in the first place, that man is under two lrinds
of government—one spiritual, by which the conscience is
formed to piety and the service of God; the other political, by
