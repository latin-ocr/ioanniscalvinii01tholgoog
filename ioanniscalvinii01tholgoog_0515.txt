Now, who can doubt the falsehood of the consequence attempt·
ed ιο be established, that the infanta who were circumcised iu
former ages, only prefigured those who are infanta in a spirit·
nal sense, being regenerated hythe word of God? Paul does
not reason in this manner, when he says, “that Jesue Christ
was a minister of the circumcision for the truth of God, to
confirm the promises made nnto the fathers ; '' (ο) asif he had
said, Since the covenant made with Abraham relatas ιο his
seed, Jesus Christ, in order to executa and discharge the
promise once pledged by the Father, carne to save the paople
of the Jews. We see how, even after the resurrectiones Christ,
Paul understands that the promise of the covenant is to be ful·
filled, not only in an allegorical sense, but, according ιο the
literal import of the words, to the natural seed of Abraham.
'ro the same effectis the declaration of Peter to the Jews,
“ 'I'he promise is unto you arrd ιο your children,” (p) aud the
appellation under which he addresses them, “Ye are the cbil·
dren of the covenant,” (q) and if children, then heire A simi·
lar sentiment is conveyed in another passage of the apostle,
which we have already quoted, where he represents the cir·
cumcision performed on infante as a testimony of the commu·
nion which they have with Christ. (r) And, on the contrary
principle, what will become of that promise, by which the
Lord, in the second precept of his law, declares ιο his servants,
that he will be merciful ιο their seed, even to a thousand
generationsi(s) Shall we here have recourse ιο allegorias?
'I'bat would be a frivolous evasion. Shall we say that this
promise is cancelled? 'Phat would be subversive of the law,
which, on the contrary, Christ came ιο establish, as a rnle, for
aholy life. lt ought ιο be admitted, therefore, beyond all
controversy, that God is so lrind and liberal ιο his servants, as,
for their sakes, ιο appoint even the children who shall descend
from them ιο be enrolled among his paople.

XVI. 'Phe other differences which they endeavour to estab-
lish between baptism and circumcision, are not only ridiculous,
aud destitute of every appearance of reason, but are even re·
pugnant to each other. For after they have affirmed that bap·
tism belongs ιο the first day of the spiritual conflict, but
circumcision ιο the eighth, wlren the mortification is already
complerem-immediately forgetting this, they change their
story, and call circumcision a signos the mortification of the
flesh, and baptisma symbol of a burial, ιο which none are to be
consigned but those who are already dead. Where can we find
another instance of such levity of aelf-contradiction? For, ac·
