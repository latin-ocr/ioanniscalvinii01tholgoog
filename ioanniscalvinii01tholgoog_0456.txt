are not consecrated to θοὰ, but to the devil. Fur why was it
lawful sor the pr'ophet to say of the Israelites, thet “they sacri-
ficed uuto devils, not ιο God,” (s) only because they had corrupt-
ed the true worship os God with profane ceremonies, and why
shall it not be lawsul sor us ιο ssy the same of the monks,
whose assumption of the hood is accompauied with the yoke
of a thousand impious superstitious? Now, what is the nature
ol· their vows? They promise to God to matntsjn perpetual
virginity, as if they lud previously stipuleted with him that
he should exempt them from the necessity os marriage. They
have no room to plead, that they make this vow merely in u
relisnee on the grace os God, sor as he declares that it is not
given to all men, (t) we have no right to entertaiu a eonfidenee
that we shall receive the special gin. Let those who possess
it use it: is they experienoe disquietude from the stimulatione
os passion, let them heve recourse to his uid by whom slone
they can be strengtnened to reslsz, Is they ase unsueeesssul. let
them not despise the remedy which is offered to them. For
those who are denied the gift os eontinenee, sse undoubtedly
called to marriage by the voice os God. By oontineuce 1 mean,

immemorisl, for persons who intended to devote themselves en-
tirely to the larci, to biud themselves by u vow os eontinence⁴
1 confess that this custom was promised in the early ages ς but
1 cannot admit those ages to have been so free from every fault,
that whatever wne done then must be received ss a rule. And
it was only by degrees thet in process of time things were carried
to such au extreme os rigour that uo une, ester having made the
vow, was permitted to recall it. This is evideut from Cyprisn.
“If virgins have saithfully dedicated themselves to God, let
them persevere in modesty and chastity without auy disguise.
Thus, being firm and constant, they rnay expect the reward of
virginity. But if they will not, or cannot per-severe, it is better
t'or them to be married, than with their pleesure to sall into
tlte lire!y With what reproaches would they now hesitate to
stigmtize a person who would wish to introduce such a rea-
sonnhle limitation of the vow of coutinenee? They have
widely deputed, therefore, from the ancient custorn, in refusing
ιο admit the lesst moderetion or relaxstion, if any one be found
