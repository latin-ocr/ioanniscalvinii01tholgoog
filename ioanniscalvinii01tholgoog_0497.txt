os remissiones sins, mortification oi the flesh, spiritual vivifi·
cation, and participation of Christ. Thus it was no injnry to
the Jews to have been circumcised by impure and apostate
priests3 nor was the sign on that account useless, so as to
render it necessary to be repeated, but it was sufficient to recur
to the genuine original. They object, that baptism ought to
be celebrated in the congregationes the godly; but this does
not prove that it loses all its value in consequence os being
partially wrong. For when we teach what ought to be done
to preserve baptism pure and free from every blemish, we do
not abolish the institution os God, however idolaters corrupt it.
For when circumcision was anciently corrupted with many
superstitious, yet it ceased not to be considered as asign os
grace, nor, when Hezelriah and Josiah assembled together out
os all lsrael those who had revolted from God, did they call
any of them to a second circumcision.

XVII. When they ask us what saith we had t‘or many years
after our baptism, in order to show that our baptism was vain,
since baptism is not sanctified to us except by the word of
promise received in faith,-to this inquiry we answer, that
being blind and unbelieving ior a long time, we did not em·
brace the promise which had been given-us in baptism, yet
that the promise itself, as it was from God, always remained
stcady, firm, and true. 'Phough all men were false and per·
fidious, yet God ceases not to be true; though all men were
lost, yet Christ remains a Saviour. We consess, therefore, that
during that time we received no advantage whatever from
baptism, because we totally neglected the promise offered to
us in it, without which baptismis nothing. Now, since, by
the grace of God, we have begua to repent, we accuse our
blindness and hardness oi beart sor our long ingratitudo to his
great goodness; yet we believe that the promise itself never
expired, but, on the contrary, we reason in the following man·
ner:-·By baptism God promises remissiones sins, and will
certainly lulfil the promise to all believers: that promise was
offered to us in baptism3 let us, therefore, embrace it by saith:
it was long dormant by reason of our unbelief ; now, then, let
us receive it by satur. Whereiore, when God exhorts the Jewish

gious hands, and who had lived for some time immersed in the
same impiety, to be circumcised again: he only urges conver·
sion of heart. For however the covenant had been violated by
theru, yet the symbol os the covenant, according to the institu-
tion ol the Lord, always remained firm and inviolable. On
the sole condition oi repentance, therefore, they were restored
to the covenant which God had once made with them in cir·
