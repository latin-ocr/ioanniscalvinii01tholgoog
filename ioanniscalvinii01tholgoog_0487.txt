“according tobis mercy he saved us, by the washing os regene-
ration, and renewing ot' the Holy Ghost ; ”(v) and by Peter,
that “baptism doth save us.'' (u) For it was not the intention
ot‘ Paul to signisy that our ablution and salvation are completed
by the water, or that water contains iu itselt‘ the virtue to puri-
t'y, regenerata, and renen, nor did Peter mean that it was the
cause os salvation, but only that the knowledge and assurance
of it is received in this sacrernent5 which is sufficiently evident
from the words they have used. For Paul connects together the
“ word os life ’² and “ the baptism ot' water 3 ’² asis he had said
that our ablution and sanctification are announced to us by the
gospel, and by baptism this message is confirmed. And Peter,
after having said that ‘⁴ baptism doth save us,’' immediately adds
that it is “not the putting away ot' the filth ot‘ tbe flesh, but the
answer os a good conscience towards God,” which proceeds
from saith. But, on the contrary, baptism promises us no other
tltltt‘htltdtlltttltltt t} tall? thille
its resemblance to washing and cleansing. Who, then, can
pretend that we are cleansed by that water, which clearly testi-
fies the blood os Christ to be our true and only ablution? So
that, to refute the error os those who refer all to the virtue of
the water, no better argument could be found, than in the signi·
fication of baptism itself, which abstracta us, as well srorn that
visible element which is placed before our eyes, as from all
other means of salvation, that it may fix our minds on Christ
alone.

Ill. Nor must it be supposed that baptism is administered
only sor the time past, so that sor sins into which we sall aller
baptism it would be necessary to seelr other new remedies os
expiation in l know not what other sacramenta, as tt the virtue
of baptism were become obsoleta. ln consequence os this error,
it happened, in former ages, that some persons would not be bap·
tired except at the close os their life, and almost in the moment
os their death, that so they might obtain pardon for their whole
lise -a preposterous cantion, which is frequently censured in
the writings of the ancient bishops. But we ought to conclude,
that at whatever time we are baptized, we are washed and
purified for the whole of lise. Whenever we have fallen, there·
t'ore, we must recur to the remembrance of baptism, and arm
cur minds with the consideration of it, that we may be always
certified and assured os the remissiori of our sins. For though,
when it has been once administered, it appears to bc past, yet
it is not abolished by subsequent sins. For the purity of
Christ is offered to us in it; and that always retains its virtue,
