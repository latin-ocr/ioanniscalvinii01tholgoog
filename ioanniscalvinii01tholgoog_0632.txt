only to combat that novel invention of a sevenlold sacrament
in ecclesiastical orders, on which not a syllable is any where
to be found, except among those sapient theologues, the Sor·
benists arrd Canonists.

XXV. Let us now examine the ceremonias which they
employ. ln the first place, all whom they enrol in their army
they initiate into tbe rank of clergy by a common sign. They
shave them on the crown of the head, that the crown may
denote regal dignity3 because ecclesiastics ought to be kings,
to rule themselves and others, according to the language in
which Peter addresses them: “ Ye are a chosen generation, a
royal priesthood‚ a holy nation,a peculiar people.’' But it
was sacrilege sor them to arrogate exclusively to themselves
that which is attributed to the whole Church, and proudly to
glory in the title which they had stolen from the believers.
Peter addresses the whole Church5 they misapply his words
to a serv shavelings, as if they were the only holy persons, as
it' they alone had been redeemed by the blood ol Christ, asil
they alone had been made by hirrr kings and priests unto God.
They proceed to assign other reasons ; that the top of their head
is laid bare, to show that their mind is sree to the Lord, and can
with open face contemplate the glory of God; or to indicate
that the laults of their mouth and eyes ought to be cnt off.
Or the tonsure of the crown significa the relinquishrnent and
renunciation os temporal things; and the hair lest round the
crown denotas the relics of property which are reserved lor
their sustenarrcc. Every thing is symbolical; because, with
respect to thern, the veil of the temple has not yet been rent
asunder. Theresore, having persuaded themselves that they
have completely discharged their duties, when they have re·
presented such things by their shaven crown, they, in reality,
fulfil none ol them. How long will they imposa upon ns with
such deceptions and falsehoods? Ecclesiastics, by shavirrg off
a lew hairs, signisy that they have relinquished an abundance
of temporal possessione, to be at liberty to contemplate the
glory os God, and that they have mortified the inordinate pro·
pensities of their ears and eyes3 but there is no class of rnen
more rapacious, ignorant, or libidinous. Why do they not
make an actual exhibition os sanctity, rather thau counterfeit
the appearance of it by falsa and delusive symbols?

XXVI. When they say that their clerical tonsure derives
its origin and reason lrom the Nazarites, what is this but de-
claring that their mysteries have sprung from Jewish cere-
monias, or, rather, are mere Judaism? But when they add,
that Priscilla, Aquila, and Paul himself, after having made a
νον), shaved their heads in order to purisy themselves, they
betray their gross ignorance. For this is nowhere said of
