the body of Christ be multiform and variable, so asto appear -

in one place, and to be invisible in another, what becomes of
the nature of a body which consists in having its proper dimetr-
sions? arrd where is its unity? With far greater propriety
Tertullian argues, that the body of Christ was a true and natu·
ral body, because the emblem of it is presented to us in the
mystery os the supper, as a pledge and assurance of spiritual
life. And, indeed, it was of his glorified body, that Christ
said, “Handle me, aud see; for a spirit hath not flesh and
bones, as ye see me have.’' (lc) We see how the truth of his
body is proved by the lips of Christ himself, because it can be
felt aud seen; deprive it of these qualities, and it will cease to
be a body. They are always recurring to their subterfuge of
the dispensation which they have invented. But it isour duty
to receive what Christ absolutely declares, in such a manner,
as to admit, without any exception, whatever he is pleased to
affirm. He proved that he was not a phantom, because he

was visible in his flesh. If that be taken away which he ·

asserts to belong to the nature of his body, will it not be neces-
sary to frame a new definition of a body? Now, with all their
sophistry, they can extract nothing to support their imaginary
dispensatius from that passage of Paul, where he says, that

„ “From heaven we look sor the Saviour, who shall change our

vile body, that it may be fashioned like unto his glorious
body.'’ (l) For we cannot hope for a conformity to Christ in
those qualities which they attribute to him, which would make
all our bodies invisible and infinite; nor will they find a man
foolish enough to be persuaded to believe so great an absurdity.
Let thern, then, no longer ascribe to the glorified body of Christ
the property of being in many places at once, or of being con·
tained within no particular space. In short, let them either
deny the resurrection of the flesh, or admit that Christ, though
clothed with celestial glory, has not divested himself of his
flesh3 for he will make us, in our flesh, partakers of the same
glory, as we shall enjoya resurrection similar to his. For
what is there more clearly stated in any part of the Scripture,
than that as Christ really assumed our flesh when he was born
of the virgin, and suffered in our ssesh to atone for our sins, so
he resumed the same flesh, at his resurrection, and carried it
up into heaven? For all the hope that we have of our resur-
rection and ascension to heaven, is founded on the resurrection
and ascension of Christ3 who, as Tertullian says, “ has taken
the pledge of our resurrection into heaven with him.'’ Now,
how weak and faint would this hope be, if the real flesh of
Christ had not truly risen from thedoad, and entered into the

(k) Lukc xxiv. 39. (f) Phil. iii. 2031.
