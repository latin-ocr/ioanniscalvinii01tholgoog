Butes it was beyond all doubt that, from the beginning even
down to their times, no change had taken place in the doctrine,
they assumed, what would suffice for the confutationes all new
errore, that they were repugnant to the doctrine which had
been constantly and unanimously maintained even from the
days of the apostles. They will gain nothing, therefore, by
persisting to disguise themselves under the name of the Church.
The Church we regard with becoming reverence; but when
they come to the definition, they are miserably embarrassed, for
they substitute an execrable harlot in the place of the holy
sponse of Christ. 'Phet we may not be deceived by such a sub·
stitution, beside other admonitione, let us remember this os Au·
gastine, for, speaking of the Church, he says, “lt is sometimes
obscured and beclouded by a multitude of scandale, sometimes
it appears quiet and unmolested in a season of tranquillity, and
iasometimes disturbed and overwhelmed with the waves of
tribulatione and temptations.’' He produces examples, that
those who were its firmest pillars, have either undauntedly suf·
fered banishment on account of the faith, or secluded them·
selvas from all society.

IV. ln the same manner, the Romanists in the present day
harass us, and terrifyignorant persons with the name of the
Church, though there are no greater enemies to Christ than
themselves. Although they may pretend therefore to the temple,
the priesthood, and other similar forms, this vain glitter, which
dazzles the eyes of the simple, ought by no means to induce us
to admit the existence of a Ohurch, where we cannot discover
the word of God. For this is the perpetual mark by which our
Lord has characterized his people: ‘⁸ Every one that is of the
truth heareth my voice.'’ (o) And, “I am the good Shepherd,
and know my sheep, and am known of mine.'’ “My sheep
hear my voice, and Ι know them, and they follow me.'' He
had just before said, “The sheep follow their shepherd; for
they know his voice; and a stranger will they not follow, but
will dee from him, for they know not the voice of strangam.” (p)
Why, then, do we wilfullyrun into error in forming a judgmcnt
of the Ohurch, since Christ has designated it by an unequivocal
character, that wherever it is discovered, it infallibly assuras
ua of the existence of a Church, and wherever it is wanting,
thare ia no real evidence of a Ohurch left. For Paul da-

clares the Church to be founded, not upon the opinions of
men, not upon the priesthood, but upon the “doctrine of the
⁴apostlea and prophets.” (q) And Jerusalem is to be distin·
guished from Babylon, the Church of Christ from the synagogae
of θείω, by this diffemnce, by which Ohrist has discriminatcd
