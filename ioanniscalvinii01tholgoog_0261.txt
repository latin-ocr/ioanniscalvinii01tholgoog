No representation could be more elegant to express that insepa-
rable connection which subsiste between all 1118 1881811818 01
Christ. We see how he continually recalls us to the fountain·
head. Therefore he pronounces the origin of heresias and
schisms to be, that 1888 neither return to the source of truth,
nor 88811 1118 Head, nor attend to the doctrine of the heavenly
Master. Now, let the Romanists exelaim 11181 we are heretica,
because we have withdrawn from their church3 while the sole
cause of 081 secession has been, that theirs 888801 possibly be
the pure profession of the truth. I say nothing of their having
expelled us with anathemes and execratione. But this reason
is more than sufficient for our exculpation, unless they ars
determined to pronounce sentence of schism also against the

gogues, of which he spelte, were then accounted legitimate
Churches. Since it 18 evident, then, that we have been cast
out, and we are prepared to prove that this has been done for
1118 name of Christ, it is necessary to inquire into the cause,
before any thing be determined respecting us, either 08 088 side
or the other. But this point lreadily relinquish to them. Itis
sufficient for me that it was necessary for us to withdraw from
them, in order to approach to 0111181.

we ought 10 hold 811 1118 0118181188 who have submitted 10 1118
