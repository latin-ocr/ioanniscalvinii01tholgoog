command given respectiug the coat, the ephod, the mitre,
the holy crown, with which Aaron was to be adorned, and
respectiug the coats, girdles, and mitres, with which his sons
were to be invested. lt was commanded to kill a bullock, to
burn his fat, to cut one rarn asunder and burn it, to sanctify
their ears and garments with the blood of another ram, and
numerous other observanceS, which 1 wonder how it is that
they have entirely omitted, aud taken only the anointiug oil.
But if they are fond of being sprinlrlod, why are they sprinkled
with oil rather than with blood? 'l'hey attempt, indeed,a most
ingenious thing; to frame one religion out of a number of
fragments collected together from Olrristiauity, Judaism, and
Paganism. Their unction, therefore, is quite fetid, for want
of the salt, the word of God. There remeius imposition of
hands, which 1 consess to be a sacrament in true and legitimate
ordinatione, but 1 deny that it has any place in this farce, in
which they neither obey the command os Christ, nor regard
the eud to which the promise ought to lead us. lf they wish
the sign not to be refused to thern, they must apply it to the very

XXXlI. Respecting the order of deacons, also, 1 should
have no controversy with them, if that office were restored to

plain that it is unjust to estimare their doctrine by the faults
of individuals3 but Iconteud that, taking their deacous exactly
as their doctrine describes them to us, it is absnrd to fetch
any testimony in their favour from the examples of those
,who were appointed deacons by the apostolic Church. 'l'hey
say that it belongs to their deacons to assist the priests, to
minister in every thing that is done in tho sacraments, as in
baptism, in chrism, to pour the wine into the chalice, to place
the bread in the patine; to lay and dispose the oblations upon
the altar, to prepare and cover the table of the Lord, to bear the
crosS, to read and chant the gospel and epistle to the people.
Is there in all this a single word of the true duty of deacous?
Now, let us hear how they aro inaugurated. On the deacon
who is ordaiued the bishop alone lays his hand3 on bis left
shoulder he places a stole, to teach him that he has taken upon
him the light yoke of the Lord, to subject to the fear of God
every thing belonging to the left side. He gives him tho text
of the gospel‚ that hc may know himself to be a herald of it.
And what have these things to do with deacons? It is no
