CHAPTER 11.

THE Taua ΛΝΒ FALSE cuuttcu conranni).

We have already stated the importance which we ought to
attach to the ministry of the word and sacraments, and the ex·
tent to which our reverence for it ought to be carried, so as to
account it a perpetual mark and characteristic of the Church.
That is to say, that wherever that existe entire and uncorrupted,
no errors and irregularities of conduct form a sufficient reason
for refusing the name of a Church. ln the next place, that the
ministry itself is not so far vitiated by smaller errors, as to be
considered on that account less legitimate. lt has further been
shown, that the errors which are entitled to this forgiveness
are those by which the grand doctrine of religion is not injured,
which do not suppress the points in which all believers ought
to agree as articles os saith, and which, in regard to the sa·
craments, neither abolish nor subvert the legitimate institution
of their Author. But assoon es falsehood has made abreach
in the fundamentals of religion, and the system of necessary
doctrine is subverted, and the use os the sacramente fails, the
certain consequence is the ruin of the Church, as there is an
end os a man's life when his throat is cut, or his heart is mor·
tall'y woundcd. And this is evident from the language of Paul,
when he declares the Ghurch to be “built upon the foundation
of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the
chief corner-stone.'’(h) Is the foundation of the Ghurch be
the doctrine of the prophets and apostles, which enjoins be·
lievers to place their salvation in Christ alone, how can the
edifice stand any longer, when that doctrine is taken away?
The Church, therefore, must of necessity fall, where that sys-
tem of religion is subverted which alone isable to sustain it.
Besides, if the true Ohurch be “the pillar and ground of
truth,'' (i) that certainly can be no Church where delusion and
falsehood have usurped the dominion.

ΙΙ. As this is the etate of things under the Papacy, it is easy
to judge how much of the Church remains there. Instead of
the ministry of the word, there reignsa corrupt government‚
composed os falsehoods, by which the pme light is suppresscd
or extinguished. An execrable sacrilege has been substituted
for the supper of the Lord. The worship of God is deformed

bya multifarious and intolerable mass of superstitious. The
doctrine, without which Christianity cannot exist, hasbeen
