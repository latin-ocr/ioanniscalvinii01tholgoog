thanksgiving and commemoration of the flesh of Christ, which
he has offered, and of his blood, which he has shed for us.’'
Hence Augustine himself, in various passages, explains it to be
nothing more than asacrifice of praise. And itis a remark often
found in his writings, that the Lord's supper is called a sacrifice,
for no other reason than because it is a memorial, image, and
attestation, of that singular, true, and only sacrifice, by which
Christ has redeemed us. There is also a remarkable passage in
his Treatise on the Trinity, where, after having treated of the
only sacrifice, he thus concludes : “ ln a sacrifice, four things are
to be considered -to whom it is offered, by whom it is offered,
what is offered, and for whom it is offered. The alone and
true Mediator, by a sacrifice of peace, reconciling us to God,
remains one with him to whom he has offered it ; makes thern
for whom he has offered itone in himself ; is the one who
alone has offered it; and is himself the oblation which he has
offered.⁷’ chrysostom also speaks to the same purpose. And
they ascribe the honour of the priesthood so exclusively to
Christ, that Augustino declares, that if any one should set up a
bishop as an intercessor between God and man, it would be the
language of Antichrist. ¹

Xl. Yet we do not deny that the oblation of Christ is there
exhibited to usin such a manner, that the view of his cross is
almost placed before our eyes; as the apostle says, that by the
preaching of the cross to the Galatians, “Christ had been evi-
dently set forth before their eyes, crucifiad among them.’' (o)
But as 1 perceive that those ancient fathers misapplied this
memorial to a purpose inconsistent with the institution of the
Lord, because the supper, as celebrated by them, represented 1
know not what appearance of a reiterated, or at least renewed
oblation, the safest way for pious minds will be to acquiesce
in the pure and simple ordinance of the Lord, whose supper
this sacrament is called, because it ought to be regulated by
his sole authority. Finding them to have retained orthodox
and pious sentiments of this whole mystery, and not detecting
them of having intended the least derogation from the one and
alone sacrifice of Christ, l dare not condemn them for impiety;
yet l think it impossible to exculpate them from having com·
mitted some error in the external form. For they imitated
the Jewish mode of sacrificing‚ more than Christ had com-
manded, or the nature of the gospel admitted. The censura
which they have deserved, therefore, is for this preposterous
conformity to the Old Testament; that, not content with the

simple and genuine institution of Christ, they have symbolized
too much with the shadows of the law.
