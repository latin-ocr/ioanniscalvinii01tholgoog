pletes the salvation to which he predestinated them in hia
eternal counsel, so he 1100 his judgments against the reprobate,
by which he executes his counsel respecting them. Those,
therefore, whom he has created to a life 01 shame and a death of
destruction, that they might be instruments 01 his wrath, and
examples of his severity, he causes to reach their appointed end,
sometimes depriving them 01 the opportunity of hearing the
word, sometimes, by the preachiug of it, increasing their blind·
ness aud stupidity. 01 the former there are innumerable exam·
ples: let us only select one thetis more evident and remarkable
than the rest. Before the advent of Christ, there passed about
four thousand years, in which the Lord concealed the light of
the doctrine of salvation from all the Gentiles. 11 11 be replied,
that he withheld from them the participation of so great a
blessing because he esteemed thern unworthy, their posterity
will be found equally unworthy 01 11. The truth of this, to
say nothing of experience, is sufficiently attested by Malachi,
who follows his reproofs of nubelief and gross blasphemiee by
an immediate prediction 01 1110 coming of the Messiah. Why,
then, is he given to the posterity rather than to their ancestors?
He will torment himself iu vain, who seelrs 101 any cause of
this beyond the secret and inscrutable counsel 01 God. Nor
need we be afraid lest any disciple 01 Porphyry should be im·
boldened to calumniata the justice of God by our silence iu its
defense. For while we assert 11101011 deserve to perish, and
it is of God's free goodness that any are saved, enough is said

isaltogether unnecessary. 'Phe supreme Lord, therefore, by
depriving 01 1110 communication 01 his light, and leaving in
darkness, those whom he has reprobated, makes way for the
accomplishment of his predestination. 01 1110 second class, the
Scriptures 0001010 many examples, and others present them·
selvas every day. The same sermon is addressed to a hundred
persons; twenty receive it with the obedience of faith3 the
others despise, or ridicule, or reject, or condemn it. 11 11 be
replied, that the difference proceeds 11010 their wickedness and
perverseness, this will afford no 0011010011οο 3 because the minda
of others would 11010 been influenced by the same wickeduess,
but for the correction 01 Divine goodness. And thus we shall
always be perplexed, unless we recur 10 Ρο01’0 (10001100-ιι Who

excellence 01 00100 men beyond others, is not from their own
