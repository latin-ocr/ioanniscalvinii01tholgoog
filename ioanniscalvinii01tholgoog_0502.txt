intrudas into another person’s office. Even in the minutest
things, asin meat and drinlr, whatever we do with a doubtful
conscience, Paul expressly declares to be sin. (y) Femalc bap-
tism, therefore, being an open violation of the 1010 delivered
by Christ, is a still greater sin; 101 we know that it is impious
tc dissever things which God has united. But all this I pass
over; arrd would only request my readers 10 consider that
nothing was further from the designes Zipporah, than to per-
form aservice to God. For seeirrg her son to be 10 danger,
she fretted and murmured‚ and indignantly cast the foreskin 00
1110 ground, reproaching her husband in such amanner as to
betray anger against God. In short, it is plain that all this
proceeded from violence of temper, because she was displeased
with God and her husband that she was constrained to shed

the blood of her son. Besides, if she had conducted herself ,

with propriety 10 all other respects, yet it was an 00101 inex·
cusable presumption for her 10 circumcise her son in the pre·
sance of her husband, and that husband not a private man, but
Moses, the principal prophet of God, who was never succeeded
by a greater in Israel; which was no more lawful 101 1101 10
do, than it is for women now to baptize in the presence 01 a
bishop. But this controversy will easily be decided by the
establishment of this principle -that infants are 001 excluded
from the kingdom of heaven, who happen 10 die before they
have had the privilege of baptism. But we have seen that it
is 00 small injustice to the covenant of God, if we do not rely
upon it as sufficient 01 itself, since its fulfilment depends not
on baptism, or on any thing adventitious. The sacrament is
afterwards added as a seal, 001 10 give efficacy to the promise
of (10110011 11 wanted validity in itself, but only 10 confirm it
to us. Whence it follows, that the children 01 believers are
not baptized, that they may thereby be made the children 01
God, as 11 they had before been strangers to the Church3 but,
011 the contrary, they 010 received into the Church by a so-
lemn sign, because they already belonged to the body 01 Christ
by virtue of the promise. 11 1110 omission 01 1110 sign, there-
fore, be not occasioned by indolence, or contempt, 01 negli-
gence, we are safe from all danger. Itis far more consistent
with piety to show this reverence 10 1110 institution 01 God, not
to receive the sacramente from any other hands than those 10
which the Lord has committed them. When it is impossible
to receive them from the Church, the grace 01 God is 001 00
attached to them, but that we may obtain it by faith from the
word of the Lord.
