this reproach. For we will answer them thus in the language
of Paul: “O man, who art thou that repliest against God?
Shall the thing formed say to him that formed it, Why hast ⁴
thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay,
of the same lump, to make one vessel unto honour and
another unto dishonour?'’(b) They will deny this to be in
reality any vindication of God’s justice, and call it a subterfuge,
such as is commonly resorted to by persons destitute of a suffi-
cient defence. For what appears to be the meaning of this,
but that God possessos power, that cannot be resisted, of doing
any thing whatsoever according to his pleasure? But it is
very different. For what stronger reason can be alleged, than
when we are directed to consider who God is? How could
any injustice be committed by him who is the Judge of the
world? If it is the peculiar property of the nature of God to
do justice, then he naturally loves righteousness and hates
iniquity. 'Phe apostle, therefore, has not resorted to sophistry,
as if he were in danger of confutation, but has shown that the
reason of the Divine justice is too high to be measured bya
human standard, or comprehended by the littleness of the hu-
man mind. 'Phe apostle, indeed, achnowledges that there is a
depth in the Divine judgments sufficient to absorb the minds
of all mankind, if they attempt to penetrate it. But he also
toaches how criminal it is to reduce the worlrs of God to such
a law, that on failing to discover the reason of them, we pre·
sume to censure them. lt isa well lmown observation of Solo-
mon, though few rightly understand it, that “ the great God,
that formed all things, both rewardeth the fool, and rewardeth
transgressors.'' (o) For he is proelaiming the greatness of God,
whose will it is to punish fools and transgressors, although he
favours them not with his Spirit. And men betray astonish-
ing madness in desiring to comprehend immensity within the
limits os their reason. 'I'he angels who stood in their integrity,
Paul calls “elect ; '’ (d) if their constancy tested on the Divino
plaasure, the defection of the others argues their being for·
saken -a fact for which no other cause can be assigned than
the reprobation hidden in the secret counsel of God.

V. Now, to any follower of Manes or Celestius, a calumni-
ator of Divine Providence, I reply with Paul, that no account
ought to be given of it, for its greatness far surpasses our un·
derstanding. What wonder or absurdity is there in this?
Would he have the Divine power so limited, as to be unable
to executa more than his little capacity can comprehend? 1
