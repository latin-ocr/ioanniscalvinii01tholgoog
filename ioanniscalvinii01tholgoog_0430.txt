abstinence from lawful enjoyrnents, that they may be more at
liberty to “give themselves to fasting and prayer.’' (ro) For
by connecting fasting with prayer as an assistance to it, he
signifies that fasting is of no importance in itself, any further
than as it is directed to this eud. Resides, from the direction
which he gives in that place to husbands and wives, to “ ren·
der to” each other “due benevolence,'' it is clear that he is
’ not speaking of daily prayers, but of such as require peculiar
earnestness of attention.

XVll. ln like manner, when war, pestilence, or famine
begins to rege, or when any other calamity appears to threaten
a country and peoplc, then also it is the duty of pastors to
exhort the Church to fasting, that with humble supplicatione
they may deprecate the wrath of the Lord3 for when he
causes danger to appear, he announces himself as prepared and
armed for vengeance. Therefore, as it was anciently the cus·
tom for criminals to appear with long beards, dishevelled heir,
and mourning apparel, in order to excite the pity of the judge;
so when we stand as criminals before the tribunal of God, it
is conducive to his glory and the general edification, as well
as expedient and salutary for ourselves, to deprecate his se·
verity by external demonstratione of sorrow. That this was
customary among the people of lsrael, ir is easy to infer from
the language of Joel; for when hc commands to “blow the
trumpet, sanctify a fast, and calla solemn assembly,” (a) and
proceeds to give other directions, hc spealrs as of things com·
monly practised. He had just before said that inquisition was
made respecting the crimes of the people, had announced that
the day of the Lord was at hand, and had cited them, as crim-
inals, to appear and answer for themselves; afterwards, he
warns thern to have recourse to saclrcloth and ashes, to weep-
ing and fastiug, that is, to prostrate themselves before the
Lord with external demonstrations of humility, Sackcloth
and ashes, perhaps, were more suitable to those times; but
there is no doubt that assembling, and weeping‚ and fastings,
and similar acts, are equally proper for us in the present age,
whenever the state of our affairs requires them. Foras it isa
holy exercise, adapted both to humble men and to consess
their humility, why should it be less used by us than by the
ancients in similar necessities? We read that fasting in token
of sorrow was not only practised by the Israelitish Church,
which was formed and regulated by the word of God, but also

by the inhabitants of Nineveh, who had no instruction except
the preaching of Jonah. (y) What cause, then, is there, why
we should not practise the same? But, it will be said, it is
