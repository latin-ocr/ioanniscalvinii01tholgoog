signated by this appellati0n3 because they did not communicate ’

that which they prehgured. Is it to be endured, that those
symbols, which the Lord consecrated with his own mouth, and
which he adorned with excellent promises, should not be ac·
knowledged as sacraments; and, at the same time, that this
honour should be transferred to those rites which are merely .
inventions of men, or, at least, are observed without any express
command of God? Either, therefore, let them change their
definition, or abstain froin this abuse of the term, which after-
wards generatos false and absurd opinions. Extreme unction‚
they say, is a figure and cause of invisible grace, because it is a
sacrament. If we ought by no means to admit their infer-
enee from the term, it certainly behoves us to lose no time in
resisting their application of the term itself, that we may not
be chargeable with giving any occasion to such an error.
Again: to prove that ceremony to be a sacrament, they allege
this reason—that it consists of the external sign and the word
of God. If we find neither command nor promise respecting
it, can we do otherwise than oppose it l

ΙΙ. Now, it appears that we are not debating about the
word, but raising a necessary and useful controversy respecting
the thing itself. We must strenuously maintain, therefore, what
we have already established by irrefragable argument that the
power to institute sacraments belongs to God alone 3 for a sa·

surance and consolation of the consciences of believers3 which
could never receive such assurance and consolation from man.
A sacrament ought to be a testimony to usos the good-will of
God towards us -a testimony which no man or angel can ever
give, esnone hasbeen “his counsellor.” It is he alone, there·
fore, who, with legitimate authority, testifies to us concerning
himself by means of his word. Α sacrament is a seal by which
the testament or promise of God is scaled. But it could not
be sealed by corporeal things and the elements of this world,
unless they were marked out and appointed for this purpose by
the power of God. Therefore man cannot institute a sacra-
meut; because it is not in human power to cause such great
and Divine mysteries to be concealed under such mean symbols.
“The word of God must precede,” as is excellently remarked
by Augustine, “in order to malie a sacrament to bea sacra·
meut.'' Moreover, if we would avoid falling into many ab
surdities, it is requisite to preserve some distinction between a
sacrament and other cerernonies. The apostles prayed on
bended linces, shall we, therefore, never ltneel without making
it a sacramenti The early Christiana are said to have turned
their faces towards the east when they prayed; shall lookiug
