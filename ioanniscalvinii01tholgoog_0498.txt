xvm. But they conceive themselves to be med with an
invincible argument, when they sllege that Paul rebaptized
some who herl previously been beptized with the baptism
os John. (t) Foris, by our own confession, the baptism of
John was in all respeets the seme as uurs is nom—se these
persons who had first been erroneously instructed, aner heving
been taught the right saith, were rebsptized imo it, so that bep-
tism, which was unseeompenied with the true doctrine, should
be considered as nothingy and we ought to be baptized asresh
into the true religion, which we heve now first imbibed. Itis
supposed by some, that they hed received their first baptism
from s pretended and corrupt imitator os John, who had rather
baptized them into a vain superstition than into the truth.
This conjecture they seem to dei-ive from the confession οἰ
those persons that they were entirely ignorant of the Holy
Spirit —en ignorance in which it is conclude-⁴1 John would not
have suffered his disciples to reme-in. But it is not probsble
that Jews, even though they hed never been bsptized nt ull,
would heve been destitute os all knowledge of the Holy Spirit,
who is celebrated in so mnny testimonies οῖ Scripture. The
answer, therefore, which they gsve, “ We heve not so much es
heard whether there be any Holy Ghost,” is to be understood
ss equivalent to s declaration thet they had never heard
whether the greces of the Spirit, respecting which Peul in-
quired‚ were given to the disciples of Christ. For myself, 1
grant thet the baptism they hed received wes the true baptism
os John, and the very same with the baptism of Christ ς but Ι
deny thet they were baptized again, What is the meaning of
these words, ‘¹ They were baptimd in the neme os the Lorrl

by Paul in the pure doctrinm but 1 prefer understending it, in

those graces by the appelletion of baptism ,· as on the dsy of
Pentecost, the spostles are said to heve remembsred the words

And Peter declared thet he remembered the same, when he
saw those greces ponred out on Cornelius and his family and
relatives. Nor is this interpretation inconsistent with what is
stated afterwards, thet “When Paul had laid his hand! upon
them, the Holy Ghost ame ou them.¹’ For Luke does not
