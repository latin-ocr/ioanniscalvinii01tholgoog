stated, that being terrified with that punishment, they adopted
ritca prescribed in the law, yet because they did not yet wor-
ship the true God aright, it is twice repeated that “they
feared the Lord,’' and, at the same time, that ‘⁴ they feared not
the Lord.’'(y) Whence we conclude, that part of the reve-
rence which is paid tobim consists in our worshipping hirn- in
a simple adherence to his commandS, without the admixture
of any inventione of our own. Hence the frequent commenda·
tions of pious kings, that they “ walked in all his command·
ments, and turned not aside to the right hand or· to the left.” (z)
rgo still further: though in some services of human invention
there appears no manifest impiety, yet assoon as ever men
have departed from the command of God, it is severely con-
demned by the Holy Spirit. The altares Ahaz, the model of
which was brought from Damascus, might seem to be an
addition to the ornaments of the temple, because his design
was to offer sacrifices upon it to God alone, with a view to per·
form these services in a more splendid manner than upon the
ancient and original altar; yet we see how the Holy Spirit
detests such audaeity, for no other reason than because all the
inventions of manin the worship of God are impure corrup·
tiens. (a) And the more clearly the will of God is revealed to
us, the more inexcusable is our presumption in making any
such attempt. Wherefore the guilt of Manasseh is justly
aggravated by the circumstance of his having “ built '² new
“altars in the house of the Lord, of which the Lord said In
Jerusalem will Iput my name;” (b) because such conduct
was like an avowed rejection of the authority of God.

XXIY. Many persons wonder why the Lord so severely
threatens that he would “do a marvellous work among the
people,¹' whose “sear toward him ” was “taught by tha
precepts ef men,¹' and pronounces that he is “worshipped in
rain ’' by “ the commandments of men.’¹ But if such persons
would consider what it is to follow the word of God alone in
matters of religion, that is, of heavenly wisdom, they would
immediately pereeive it to be for no trivial reason that the Lord
abominatas such corrupt services, which are rendered to him
according to the caprice of the human mind. For, though
persons who obey such laws for tbe worship of God, have a
certain appearance ef humility in this their obedience, yet they
are very far from being humble before God, to whom they
proscribe the same laws which they observa themselves. This
is tbe reason why Paul requires us to be so particularly cautious
against being deceived by the traditions of men, and will·
