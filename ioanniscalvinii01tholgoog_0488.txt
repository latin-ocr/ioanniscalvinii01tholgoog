is never overcome by any blemishes, but purifies and obliteratae
all our defilements. Now, from this doctrine we ought not to
take a license for the commission of future sins, for it is very
far from inculcating such presumption; it is only delivered to
those who, when they have smned, groan under the fatigue
and oppression of their transgressions3 in order to afford them
some relief and consolation, and to preserve thern from siuking
into confusion and despair. Thus Paul says, that Christ was
“set forth to be a propitiation for the remissiori of sins that
are past.’' (a) He does not deny that we have a constant aad
perpetual remissiori of sins in Christ, but signifies that he has
been given by the Father only to miserable sinners, who sigh
for the physician to heal the wounds of aguilty conscience.
To such the mercy of God is offered; while those who, from a
remissiori of punishment, seek to derive an occasion and license
for sinning, do nothing but draw down upon themselves the
wrath and vengeance of God.

lV. Iknow the common opinion is, that remission of sins,
which at our first regeneration we receive by baptism alone, is
afterwards obtained by repentance and the benefit of the lreya
But the advocates of this opinion have fallen into an error, for
want of considering that the power of the keys, of which they
speak, is so dependent on baptism that it cannot by any means
be separated from it. Itis true, that the sinner receives re·
mission by the ministry os the Church; but not without the
preaching of the gospel. Now, what is the natum of that
preaching? That we are cleansed from our sins by the blood
of Christ. What sign and testimony of that ablution is there,
except baptism? We see, then, how this absolution is referred
to baptism. This error has produced the imaginary sacrament
of penanee3 on which 1 have touched a little already, and shall
finish what remeius in its proper place. Now, it is no wonder
if men, whose groveling minds were inordinately attached to
external things, have betrayed that corrupt propensity, by a
discontent with the pure institution of God, and an introduc·
tion of new expedients invented by themselves3 aa if baptism
itself were not a sacrament of repentancs ; butif repentance
be enjoined upon us as long aa we live, the virtue of baptism
ought to be extended to the same period. Wherefore it is
evident that the pious‚ whenever, in any part of their lives, they
are distressed with a consciousness of their sins, may justly have
recourse to the remembrance of baptism, in order to confirm
themselves in the confidence of their interea in that one per-
petual ablution which is enjoyed in the blood of Christ.

V. Baptism is also attended with another advantage: it
