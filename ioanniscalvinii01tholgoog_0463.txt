one thing, the permanent virtue is another. ‘This is the
word of saith which we preach,' (e) says the apostle. Whence
it is said os the Gentiles, in thc Acts of the Apostles, that ‘ God
purifies their hearts by faith' (f) And the apostle Peter says,
‘Baptism doth also now save us, (not the putting away of the
filth of the flesh, but the answer of a good conscience towards
God.)' (g) ‘This is the word os saith which we preach,'
by which baptism is consecrated to endue it with a purifying
virtue.” We see how he makes the preaching of the word
necessary to the productiora of saith, And we need not labour
much to prove this, because it is very plain what Christ did,
what he commanded us to do, what the apostles followed, and
what the purer Church observed. Even from the beginning
of the world, whenever God gave the holy fathers any sign,

· it is well known to have been inseparably connected with some

doctrine, without which our sensas would only be astonished
with the mere view of it. Therefore, when we hear men·
tion made of the sacramenta} word, let us understand it of the
promise, which, being audibly and intelligibly preached by the
minister, instructs the people in the meaning and tendency of
the sign. .

V. Nor ought any attention to be paid to some, who endea-
vour to oppose this byadilemma which discovers more subtlety
than solidity. They say, Either we know that the word of
God which precedes the sacramentis the true will of God,
or we do not know it. lf we know it, then we learn nothing
new from the sacrament which follows. If we do not know
it, neither shall we learn it from the sacrament, the virtue of
which lies entirely in the word. Let it be concisely replied,
that the seals appended to charters, patents, and other public
instrumenta, are nothing, taken by themselves3 because they
would be appended to no purpose, if the parchment had nothing
written upon it; and yet they nevertheless confirmanti authen·
ticate what is written on the instrumento to which they are
annexed. Nor can it be objected that this similitude has been
recently invented by us, for it has been used by Paul himself,
who calls circumcision a seol,(}t) apgayrda, ina passage where
he is professedly contending that circumcision did not constitute
the righteousness of Abraham, bnt was a seal of that covenant,
in the saith of which he had already been justified. And what
isthere that ought to give any man much offence, if we teach
that the promise is scaled by the sacramenta, while it is evi· ·
