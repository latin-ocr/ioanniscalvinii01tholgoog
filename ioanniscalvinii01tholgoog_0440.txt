consequence of their rivalling each other in the contrivance of
vows to add a stronger and stricter obligation to the common
bonds. As we have shown that the service of God was corrupt·
ed by the audacity of those who domineered over the Ohurch
under the title of pastore, insuering unhappy eonscienccs
with their unjust laws; it will not be irrelevant here to expose
a kindred evil, in order to show that men, in the depravity
of their hearts‚ have opposed every possible obstacle to those
means by which they ought to have been conducted to God.
Now, to malie it more evident that vows have been productive
of the most serious mischiefs, it is necessary to remind the
readers of the principles already stated. In the first place, we
have shown that every thing necessary to the regulation of a
picus and holy life is comprehended in the law. We have also
shown, that the Lord, in order to callus off more effectually
from the contrivanoe of new worlrs, has included all the praise
of righteousness in simple obedience to his will. If these
,things be truc, the conclusion is obvious, that all the services
which we invent for the purpose of gaining the favour of God,
are not at all acceptable to him, whatever pleasure they may
afford to ourselves; and, in fact, the Lord himself, in various
places, not only openly rejects them, but declares them to be
objects of his utter abomination. Hence arises a doubt respect·
ing vows which are made without the authority of the express
word of God, in what light they are to be considered, whether
they may be rightly made by Christian men, and how far they
are obligatory upon them. For what is styled a promise among
men, in reference to God is called a voro. Now, we promise to
men either such things as we thirrlr will be agreeable to them,
or such as we owe them on the ground of duty. There is
need, therefore, of sar greater care respecting vows, which are
addressed to God himself, towards whom we ought to act with
the utmost seriousness. But here superstition has prevailed, in
all ages, to a wonderful degree, so that, without judgment or
discretion, men have precipitately vowed to God whatever was
uppermost in their minds, or¹ even ou their lips. Hence those
fooleries, and even monstrous absurdities of vows, by which
the heathen insolently trifled with their gods. And l sincerely
wish that Christiane had not imitated thern in such audacity.
This ought never to have been the case; but we see, that for
several ages nothing has been more common than this pre-
sumption; amidst the general contempt of the law of God, peo-
ple have been all inflamed witha mad passion for vowiug
whatever had delighted thern in their dreams. l have no wish
to proceed to an odious exaggeratur, or a particular enumera·
tion of the enormity and varieties of this offenee3 but 1 have

thought it proper to5rpake these remarks by the way, «Ἢ
