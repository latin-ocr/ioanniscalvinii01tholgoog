obtain relies from pain 3 not meaning that sins are effeced by unc·
tion, but that the prayers of the believers‚ by which the afflicted
brother shall have been commended to God, shall not be in
vain. These men impiously pretend, that sins are remitted
by their holy‚ or, to spealr more properly, abomineble unction.
See what lengths they will go, when they shall be allowed to
abuse that passage of James by their absurd interpretation.
And we need not labour any longer in the proos 3 even their
own historias relieve us from this difficulty. For they relate,
that Pope Innocent‚ who presided over the Church of Rome
in the time ot' Augustius, decreed that not only elders, but also
all Christiane, should use oil, in case of illoesa, for the purpose
of anointing themselves or their friends.

XXII. The fourth place in their catalogue is occupied by the
sacrament of ordors; but this is so fertile that it is the parent
os seven little sacramenta which arise out of it. Now, it is
truly ridiculous sor them to affirm, thet there are seem sacra·
ments, and when they proceed to specisy them, to enumerate
thirteen. Nor can they plead, that the seven sacramente of
orders are only one sacrament, because they all belong to one
priesthood, and form, as it were, so many steps to it. For, as it
appears that in all os thern there are different ceremonies, and
they themselves say that there are different graces, no person
can doubt that, is their principles be admitted, they ought to
be called seven sacramente. And why do we controvert itas
a doubtful thing, when they themselves plainly and distinctly
declare that there are seven? In the first place, we will briefly ,
suggest by the wey what numerous and great absurdities they
obtrude upon us, when they wish us to receive their orders as
sacraments; and then we will inquire, whether the ceremony
which the churches use in ordaining ministers ought to be
called a sacrament at all. They mention seven ecclesiastical
orders or degrees, which they dignify with the name ot' sacra·
ment. They are-beadleS, readers, exorcista, acolotbists,
subdeacons, deacons, priests. And they are seven, it is said,
on account of the sevenfold grace os the Holy Spirit, with
which those who are promoted to theru ought to be endued3
but it is increased‚ and more abundantly communiceted to
them, in their promotion. Now, tbe number itsels is conse·
crated by aperverse interpretation os the Scripture3 because
