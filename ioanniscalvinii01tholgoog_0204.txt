XVII. lf this be correct, it will be said there can be but little
saith in the promises of tlre gospel, which, in declaring the will
of God, assert that he wills what is repugnant to his inviolable
decree. But this is far from a just conclusion. For is we turn
our attention to the effect of the promises of salvation, we shall
find that their universality is not at all inconsistent with the
predestination of the reprobate, We know the promises to be
effectual to us only when we receive thern by saith, on the
contrary, the annihilation of saith isat once an abolition of the
promises. lt this is their nature, we may perceive that there is
no discordance between these two things-God’s having ap-
pointed from etemity on whom he will bestow his favour and
exercise his wrath, and his proclaiming salvation indiscriminately
to all. Indeed, I maintain that there is the most perfect har·
mony between them. For his sole design in thus promising, is
to offer his mercy to all who desire and seek it, which none do
but those whom he has enlightened, and he enlightens all whom
he has predestinated to salvation. These persons experience
the certain and unshaken truth of the promises; so that it can·
not be pretended that there is the least contmriety between
God's eternal electiori and the testimony ot' his grace offered to
believers. But why does he mention all? Itis in order that
the consciences of the pious may enjoy the more secure satis-
faction, seeing that there is no difference between sinners,
provided they have faith; and, on the other hand, that the
impious may not plead the want os an asylum to flee to from
the bondage of sin, while they ungratesully reject that whichis
offered to them. When the mercy of God is offered to both by
the gospcl, it is saith, that is, the illumination of God, which
distinguishes between the pious and impious; so that the former
experience the efficacy of the gospel, but the latter darive no
benefit from it. Now, this illumination is regulated by God's
eternal election. The complaint and lamentation of Christ,
“O Jemsalem, Jerusalem, how osten would Ι have gathered
thy children together, and ye would not,” (a) however they
cite it, affords thern no support. Ι confess, that Christ here
speaks not merely in his human character, but that he is np-
braiding the Jews for having in all ages rejected his grace. But
we must define the will os God which is here intended. Itis
well known how sedulously God laboured to preserve that
people to himself, and with what extrema obstinacy, from the
first to the last, they refused to be gathered, being abandoned
to their own wandering desires; bnt this does not authorize
the conclusion, that the counsel of God was frustrated by the
wickedness of men. They object, that nothing is more incon·
