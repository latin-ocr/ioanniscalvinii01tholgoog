us to Christ. 'I'hey suppose Christ not to be present, unle-
be descende to us; as though we cannot equally enjoy his
presence, if he elevatos usto himself. 'Phe only question
between us, therefore, respecta the manner of thia presence;
because they place Christ in the bread, and we think it unlaw·
ful for us to bring him down from heaven. Let the readers
judge on which side the trnth lies. Only let us hear uo more
of that calumny, that Christ is excluded from the sacrament,
unless he be concealed under the bread. For as this is a hea-¹
venly mystery, there is no necessity to bring Christ down to
the earth, in order to be united to us.

XXXII. If any one inquire of me respecting the manner, 1
shall not bc ashamed to acknowledge, that it is a mystery too
sublime for me to be able to express, or even to eomprehend;
and, to be still more explicit, 1 rather experience it, than un·
derstand it. Here, therefore, without any controversy,l em·
brace the truth os God, on 'which l can safely rely. He pro·
nounces his fiesh to be the food, and his blood the drink, of
my soul. Ioffer him my soul, to be nourished with such ali·
ment. In his sacred supper, he commands me, under the sym·
bols of bread and wine, to take, and eat, and drink, his body
and blood. 1 doubt not that he truly presente, and that l re·

of his human nature, and are at the same time repugnant to
the word of God, which informs us that Christ has been re·
ceived into the glory of the celestial kingdom, where he is
exalted above every condition of the world, and which is equally
careful to attribute to his human nature the properties cf real
humanity. Nor ought this to seem incredible or unreasonable,
because, as the kingdom of Christ is wholly spiritual, so his
communications with his Clrureh are not at all to be regulated by
the order of the present world; or, to use the words of Augus·
tine, “This mystery, as well as others, is celebrated by man,
but in a Divina manner ; it is administered on earth, but in a
heavenly manner.” The presence of Christ’s body,I say, is
- such as the nature of the sacrament requires; where we affirm
that it appears with so much virtue and efficacy, as not only to
afford cur minds an undoubted confidence of eternal life, but
also to give us an assurance of the resurrection and imrnortality
of our bodies. For they are vivified by his immortal flesh,
and in some degree participate his imrnortality. Those who
go beyond this in their hyperbolical representatione, merely
obscure the simple and obvious truth by such intricaeies. ll
any person be not yet satisfied, 1 would request him to con·
sider, that we are now treating of a sacrament, every part of
which ought to be referred to saith. Now, we fecd our saith
