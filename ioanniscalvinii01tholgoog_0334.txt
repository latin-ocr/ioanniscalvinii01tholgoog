XVI. But a little while aster, John, who presided ¹over the
Ohurch 01 Constantinople while Gregory was bishopofRome, had
. the arrogance to assume the title 01 universal patriarch. Gregory,
not afraid 01 defending his see In a good cause, resolutely
opposed this assumption. And certainly it betrayed intolera-
ble pride and folly in John to wish to make the limita 01 his
bishopric the same with theseos the¹ empire. Now, Gregory did
not claim to himself what he denied to another ; but execrated

bidden it, you have taken care to introduce that appellation 01

XVII. At length Phocas, who ascended the throne 01101 the
murder 01 Mauritius, being more favoureble to the Romans, —— for
what reason I know not, unless because he had been crowned
at 1101110 without any difficulty, —- granted to BoniIace the Thnd
what Gregory had never demanded-that Rome should be
the head 01 011 Ghurches. 'I'hus the controversy was decidcd.
