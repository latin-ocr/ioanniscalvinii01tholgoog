the doctrine. For the faithful under the former dispensatiou
were directed to seek the iace of God in the sanctuary ς (t) and

this is so frequently repeated in the law, sor no other reason,
but because the doctrine of the law and the exhortations of the
prophets exhibited to thern a lively image os God; as Paul
declares that his preaching displayed “the glory of God in the
iace of Jesus Christ.’' (v) And in so much the greater detesta-
tion ought we to hold those apostatas, who make it their study
to cause divisions in churches, as if they would drive away the
sheep stom the fold, and throw them into the jaws of wolvea
But let us remember what we have quoted from Panl— that

the Ghurch can only be edified by the preaching os this word,
and that the saints have no common bond of union to hold

them together, any longer than, while learning and profiting
with one accord, they observe the order which God has pre·
scribed sor the Ghurch. lt was principally for this end, ael
have already stated, that the faithful under the law were com-
manded to resort to the sanctuary; because Moses not only
celebrates it as the residence of God, but likewise declares it to
be the place where God has fixed the record of his name ; (ro)
which without the doctrine of piety, he plainly suggests, would
be oi no use. And it is undoubtedly sor the same reason that·
David complains, with grem bitterness of soul, of being pre·
vented from access to the tabernacle by the tyrannical cruelty
os his enemies. (r) 'l'o many persons perhaps this appears to
be a puerile lamentation, because it could be but a very trivial
loss, and not a privation of much satisfaction to be absent frent
the court of the temple, provided he were in the possession of
other pleasnres. But by this one trouble, anxiety, and sorrow,
he complains that he is grieved, tormented, and almost con-
sumed; because nothing is more valned by believers than
this assistance, by which God gradually raises his people srotn
one degree oi elevation to another. For it is also to be re·
marked, that God always manifested himself to the holy tit·
thers, in the minor ot‘ his doctrine, in such a manner that their
knowledge of him was spiritual. Hence the temple was
not only called his sace, but in order to guard against all sn·
perstition, was also designated as his sootstool. (y) And thiais
that happy conjunction in the unity of the saith spoken os by
Paul, when all, from the highest to the lowest, are aspiring
towards the head. All the temples which the Gentiles erected
to God with any other design, were nothing but a profanaticn
of his worship-a crime which, though not to an equal extent,
was also frequently committed by the Jewsn Stephon re·
