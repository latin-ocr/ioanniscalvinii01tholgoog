VI. lt will not now be difficolt to conclude what ideas
ought to be entertained of vows universally. There isone
vow common to all believers, which is made in baptism, and
confirmed and established by usin the profession of our faith
in the Catachism, and in the reception of the Lord’s supper.
For the sacraments resemble covenants, or instrumente oi
agreement, by which God conveys his mercy to us, and in it
eternal life3 and we, on the other hand, promise him obedi·
enee. Now, the form, or at least the sum of the vow is, that,
renouncing Satan, we devote ourselves to the service of God,
to obey his holy commanda, and not to follow the corrupt
inclinations of the llesh. This vow being sanctioned by the
scripture, aud even required of all the children of God, it
ought not to be doubted that it is holy and useful. lt is no
objectiorr to this, that no man in the present life performs the
perfect obedience which God requires of us, for as this stipu-
lationis included in the covenant of grace, which contains
both remissiori of sins and the spirit of sanctification, the
promise which we then make is connected with, and pre·
supposes our supplicatiou for mercy, and our solicitation for
assistance. ln judging of particular vows, it is necessary to
remembcr the three rules which we have given, which will
enable us to form a correct estimato of the nature of every
vow. Yet 1 would not be thought to carry my recommenda-
tiou, even of those vows which I maintain to be holy, so far as
to wish their daily use. For though Ι venture to determine
nothing respecting the number or time, yet, if any person
would follow my advice, he will melre none but such as are
sober, and of short duration. F'or if any one often recur to
the making of many vove, all religion will be injured by their
frequency, and there will be great danger of falling into super·
stition. lf any one bind himself by a perpetual vow, he will
not discharge it without great trouble and difficulty, or, wea-
ried by its long continuauce, he will at length violate it al-
together.

vll. Now, it is evident what great superstition has for some
ages prevailed in the world on this subject. One person vowed
that he would drink no wine; as though abstinenee from wine
were a service in itself acceptable to God. Another obliged him·
self to l'ast; another to abstain from meat on certain days, which
he had falsely imagined to possess some peculiar sanctity beyond
others. There were some vows far more puerile, though not
made by children. For it was esteemed great wisdom to vow
pilgrimages to places of more thart common holirress, and to
perform the journey either on foot, or with the body hals
naked, that the merit might be augmented by the fatigue.
These, and similar vows, with an incredible rege for which the
