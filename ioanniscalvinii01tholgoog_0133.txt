superfluous. But if the name of God be tmly hallowed, when
separated from all others it breathes pure glory, we are here
commanded to pray, not only that God will vindicate his holy
. name from all contempt and ignominy, but also that he will
constrain all mankind to revere it. Now, as God manifeste
himself to us partly by his word, and partly by his works, he
is no otherwise hallowed by us, then if we attribute to him in
both instanoes that which belongs to him, and so receive what·
ever proceeds from him; ascribing, moreover, equal praise to
his severity and to his clemency; since on the multiplicity and
variety of his works he has impressed characters of his glory,
which should draw from every tongue a confession of his praise.
Thus will the Scripture obtain a just authority with us, nor
will any event obstruet the benedictione which God deserves
in the whole course of his govemment of the world. The
tendeney of the petitionis, further, that all impiety which sul·
lies this holy name, may be utterly abolished3 that whatever
obscures or diminishes this hallowing, whether detraction or
derision, may disappear; and that while God restrains all
sacrilege, his majesty may shine with increesing splendent.
XLII. The second petition is, Turn run rrnonorr or Gon
rur eoum which, though it continue nothing new, is yet not
without reason distinguished from the firet3 because, if we con·
sider our inattention in the most important of ell concerns, it is
useful for that which ought of itself to have been most inti·
mately known to us, to be inculcated ina variety of words.
Therefore, after we have been commanded to pray to God to
subdue, and at length utterly to destroy, every thing thet sullies

, his holy name, there is now added another petition, similar and

almost identically the same-That his kingdom may come.
Now, though we have already given a definition of this king-
dom, 1 now briefly repeat, that God reigns when men, renonu-
cing themselves end despising the world and the present state,
submit themselves to his righteousness, so as to aspire to the
heavenly state. Thus this kingdom eonsists of two parts; the
one, God’s correcting by the power of his Spirit all our carnal
and depraved appetites, which oppose him in great numbers,
the other, his forming all our powers to an obedience to his
commands. No others therefore observa a proper order in this
petition, but they who begin from themselves, that is, that they
may be purified from all corruptions which disturb the tran·
quillity‚ or violate the purity, of God's kingdom. Now, since
the Divino word resembles a royal sceptro, we are commanded
to pray that he will subdue the hearts and minds of all men to
a voluntary obedience to it. This is accomplished, when, by
thesecret inspirationes his Spirit, he displays the efficacy of ‚
hia word, and causes it to obtain the honour it deserves.
