less things, which we see in the mass. But they object that
it was au ancient opinion, that whatever was done with the
common consent os the universal Ghurch, had originated t‘rom
the apostles. ln proos ol this, they cite the testimony os Au-
gustino. l shall give thern no other answer than iu the words
os Augustius himself. “Those things which are observed
throughout the world‚’' says he, “ we may understand to have
been crdained, either by the apostles themselves, or by general
ccuncils, whose authority is very usesul in the Ghurch3 as
that the sufferiugs, resurrection, and ascension os our Lord, and
the descent cf the Holy Spirit, are celebrated by solemn anni·
versaries; and if there be any thing else of a similar lrind
observed by the universal Church wherever it has extended
itsels.'' When he enumerates so few examples, who does not
see that he intended to attribute to authors· worthy os credit
aad reverence the observances which were then in use, and
none but those simple, rare, and sober ones, which are useful
in preserving the order οἱ the Ghurch? But how distantis
this passage from the conclusion the Roman doctore would
extort stom it, that there is not the most insignificant ceremony
among them which ought not to be considered as testing on
the authority of the apostles!

· XX. Not to be too tedicus, l will produce only one example.
If any one inquire whence they have their holy water, they
immediately ansver, From the apostles. Asis the historias
did not attribute this invention to a bishop of Rome, who, if
he had taken conusel os the apostles, would certainly never
have contaminated baptism by a strange and unseasonable
, symbol. Though it does not appear to me probable that the
origin os that consecration vas so ancient as those histories
state. For the observaticn os Augustius, that some Ghurches
in his time rejected the custom of washing the leet as a solemn
imitation os Christ, lest that cercgnony might be supposed to
have any reference to baptism, implies that there was no other
lrind os washing theu practised which bore any resemblance to
baptism. Be this as it may, Ishall never admit it to have
been a dictate of the spirit oi the apostleS, that baptism should
be recalled to the memory by a daily ablution, which would
be little else than arepetition os it. It is of no consequence
that Angustiae elsewhere ascribes other things also to the
apostles; sor as he hes nothing but conjectures, uo conclusion
ought to be drawn from them on such an important subject.

Lastly, though we should even grant, that those things which
he mentions had been transmitted srom the time of the apostles,
yet there is a wide difference between instituting some picus
exercise which believers may use with a free conscience, or
if they find uot profitable, may abstain from tbe use os it, and
