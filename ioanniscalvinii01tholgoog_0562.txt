day. Iam fully aware that our adversaries contemptuously
elude the passages which are adduced for this purpose.(d)
Whenever Christ speaks of his approaching departure from the
world, they reply that this departure was nothing more thau a
change of his mortal state. But if this were correct, Christ
would not substitute the Holy Spirit to supply the defectos
his absence, as they express it, since the Spirit does not
succeed to his place, nor does Christ himself descend again
from the glory of heaven to assume the condition of this mortal
life. The advent of the spirit, and the ascension of Christ,
are clearly opposed to each other; aud, therefore, it is impossi-
blc for Christ to dwell with us, according to his desh, iu the
same manner in which he sends his Spirit. Besides, he ex·
pressly declares that hc shall not always be with his disciples
in the world. (c) This declaration also they thinlr they have
completely explained away, by saying that Christ merely
intended that he should not always bc poor and mean, and
exposed to the necessities of this transitory life. But they are
evidently contradicted hythe context, which relatos, not to
his poverty, or indigence, or any of the miseries of this life,
¹ but to his receptiou of respect and honour. The unctiori per-
formed by the woman displeased the disciples, because they
thought it an uuuecessary and useless expense, bordering on
luxury 3 and, therefore, they wished that the value of the oint·
ment, which they considered as improperly lavished, had been
distributed to the poor. Christ said, that he should not always be
present to receive such honour. Augustino has given the same
explanation of this passage, iu the following explicit language:
-“ When Christ said, Me ye have not always with you,
he spolie of the presence of his body. For according to his
majesty‚ his providencc, and his ineffable and invisible grace,
is accomplished what he said on another occasion—Lu, l am
with you always, even to the end of the world3 but, with
respect to the body, which the Word assumed, which was
born of the virgin, which was apprehended by the Jews, which
was affixed to the tree, which was taken down from the cross,
which was wrapped in linen clothes, which was laid in the
sepulchre, which was manifested at the resurrection, this de-
claration is fulfilled - Me ye have not always with you. Why l
Because in his corporeal presence he conversed with his disci-
ples for forty days, and while they were attending him, seen,
but not followed by them, he ascended to heaven. He is not
here; for hc sits at the right hand of the Father: and yet he
is here; for he has not withdrawn the presence of his majesty:
otherwise, according to the presence of his majesty‚ we have
