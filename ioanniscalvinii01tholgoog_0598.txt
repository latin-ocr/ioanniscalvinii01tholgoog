tho Gentiles were to be introduced to s panieipution os the
true religion ς as it is their invariable practice, un all occasions,
w describe the malitie, which have been exhibited in the
gospel, under the types aud figures os the dispensation under
which they lived. Thus, conversim] to the Lord they express
by going up to Jenisalem; adomtion os God, by oblations os
various gists; the more extensive knowledge to be bestowed
on believers, in the kingdom os Christ, by dreams and visions. (d)
The prophecy which they adduce, therefore, is similar to another
prediction os lanan, where he foretells the ereetiou osthree altam,
in Assyria, Egypt, and ludes-(e) 1 ask the Romanists, first,
whether they do not admit this prediction to have been accom-
plished in the kingdom os Christ; seeondly, where ere these
altars, or when were they ever erected3 thirdly, whether they
think that those two kingdoms were destined to have their

the prophet, under types adopted to his own tirne, was pre-
dicting the spiritual worship or flod, which was to be propa-
gnted all over the world. This is our solution of the psmge
which they adduce from Malachi; bnt ns examples of this

that os the mass ; whereasy believers do in reality now sacrifice
tn the Iar-⁴1, and offer n pure oblation, of which we shnll
presently trent.

V. 1 now proceed to the third view os the mass, under
which 1 nm ιο show how it obliterates und sxpunges from the
memory os mankind the true und alone death os Jesus Christ.
For as among men the confirmation os a testament depends on
the death of the testator, so also our Lot-⁴1, by his death, ha.-
eonflrrned the testamen! in which he lus given us remissiori
ot· sins, and evarlasting righteousness These who dare ιο
attempt any variation or innovation in this testament, thereby
deity his death, md represent it ns os no velue. Now, what is
the mass, but a new and totally different testu-nent? For
does not every separate rnsss promise a new remissiori of sins,
and a new uequisition of righteousness5 so that there are now
n many testaments as messes? Let Christ, therefore, eume
again, and by another death rstify this new testament, or rather,
by innumeruble deutha, confirm these innumernble testamenta
os masse* l-Inve 1 not truly said, theu, at the beginning¹ that
the true and alone death os Christ in obliterated und contignat
ιο ohlivion by the messes? And is not tlte dim! m
