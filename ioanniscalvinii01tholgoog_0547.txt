, there is uo such declaration, they say, respecting baptism as
there is respecting the supper: “ This is my body.’' As though

the question related to those words, which have a meaning ob-
vious enough, and not rather to the conversion or change spoken
of, which ought to signify no more in the supper than in baptism.
Let them oease their verbal subtleties, therefore, which only
betray their own absurdity. Indeed, there would be no consis-
tency iu the signification, if the external sign were not a living
image of the truth which is represented in it. By the externa}
sign, Christ intended to declara that his flesh is meat. If he
were to set before us a mere spectra of bread, and not real
bread, where would be the analogy or similitude, which ought
to lead us from the visible emblem to the invisible substance?
For, to preserve the correspondence complete, the signification
would extend no further than that we should be fed with an
appearance of the flesh of Christ. As in baptism, if there were
nothing but an appearance of water to deceive our eyes, we
should have no certain pledge of our ablution; and such an
illusive representation we should find a source of painful uncer-
tainty. 'Phe nature of the sacrament, therefore, is subverted,
unless the earthly sign correspond in its signification to the
heavenly substance; and, cousequently, we lose the truth of
this mystery, unless the true body of Christ be represented
by real broad. lrepeat it again; since the sacred supper is
nothing but a visible attestation of the promise, that Christis
“the bread of life which cometh down from heaven,’' (a) it
requires the use of visible aud material breed to represent that
which is spiritual; unless we are detennined that the means
which God hindly affords to support our wealrness shall be
altogether unavailing to us. With what reason could Paul con·
clude that “ we, being many, are oue breed, for we are all par·
takers of that one brcad,” (y) if there were nothing but a mere
phantom of bread, and not the true and real substance of it?

XV. They would never have been so shamefully deluded
by the fallacias of Satan, if they had not been previously fas·
cinated with this error-that the body of Christ contained in
the brcad was received in a corporea] manner into the mouth,
and actually swallowed. The cause of such a stupld notion
was, that they considered the consecration as a kind of magical
incantation. But they were unacquainted with this principle,
that the bread is a sacrament only to those to whom the word
is addressed; as the water of baptism is not changed in itself,
but on the annexatioo of the promise, begins to be tous that
which it was not before. 'ruis will be further elucidated by
the example ofa similar sacrament. The water which flowed
from the mck in the wilderness, was to tha fathers a tohan aad
