God with gentleness of heart; not preferring your leisure to the
necessities os the Church, whom, if no good men had been
disposed to assist in the production os her children, you cannot
discover how you could yourselves have been born.” He hero
speaks os the ministry, which is the means os the regeneration
os believers. Again, in an epistle to Aurelius, he says: “ lt
causes an occasion of falling to themselves, and a most injurious
indignity to the ecclesiastical order, if the deserters os monas·
teries are chosen to clerical offices; while os those who remain
in the monastery, we are accustomed to promote to such offices
only the best aud most approved. Unless, perhaps, as the
common people say,A bad daneer is a good musician, so it
should be jocularly said os us, Α bad monk will be a good minis-
ter. It is too much to be lamented, is we stimulate monks to such
ruinous pride, and think the clergy deserving os such heavy
disgrace; whereas, sometimes even a good monk will hardly
make a good priest, is he has sufficient continence, and yet
is deficient in 'necessary leaming.” From these passages it
appears that pious men were aecustomed to prepare themselves,
by monastic discipline, for the govemment os the Church,
that they might be the better qualified to undertake such
an important office. Not that all monks attained this end;
or even aimed at ir; sor they were in general illiterato men,
but those who were qualified were selected.

IX. But Augustine has given us a portraiture of the ancient
monachism‚ principally in two places, in his treatise· On the
Manners of the Catholic Church, in which he defends the
sanctity of that profession against the calumnies os the Manichae-
ans; and in another book, On the Labour ol Monks, in which
he inveighs against some degenerate monks, who had begun to
his own words. “Despisiug the Ἧίιποωὲἐηῐε of thidotsvsorld:
united in a common lise of the strictest chastity and holiness,
they spond their time together, living in prayers, in readings,
and in conferences, neither inflated with pride, nor turbulent
with obstinocy, nor pale with envy. No one possesses any
thing of his own; no one is burdensome to another. Bytho
labour of their hands, they procuro those things which are
sufficient to support the body, without hindering the mind from
devotion to God. Their worlr they deliver to those who are
called Deans. These Deans dispose of every thing with great
care, and render an account to one, whom they call Father.
Most holy in their manners, pree'minent in divine learning, and
excelling in every virtue, these Fathers, without any pride,
consult the welsare os those whom they call children, com·
