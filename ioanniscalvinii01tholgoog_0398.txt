while ceremonias are employed lo conciliate veneration to sa·
cred things, we may be excited to piety by such aids3 partly
that the modesty and gravity, which ought to be discovered in
all virtuous actions, may be most of all conspicuous in the
Church. ln order, the first point is, that those who preside
should be acquainted with the rule and law of good govem-
ment, and that the people who are governed should be accus·
tomed to an obedience to God and to just discipline, the second
is, that when the Ghurch is in a well regulated state, care should
be taken to preserve its peace and tranquillity.

XXIX. We shall not call that decorum, therefore, which is
merely a frivolous spectacla, yielding an unprofitable gratifica·
tion; such as we see exemplified in the theatrical apparatus
employed by the Papists in their services, where nothing is to
be seen but a useless appearance of elegance and splendour‚
without any advantage. But we shall esteem that as decorum,
which shall be so adapted to inspire a reverence of holy myste-
ries as to be calculated for an exorciso of piety; or which at
least shall contributa an ornament corresponding to the act;
and that not without some beneficial tendency, but that be-
lievers may be admouished with what modesty, fear, and rever-
ence, they ought to engage in sacred services. Now, that cere·
monies may be exercises of piety‚ it is necessary that they
should lead us directly to Christ. ln like manner, we do not
place order in those nugato'ry pomps which have nothing but
a vain appearance of splendour‚ but in that well regulated
polity, which excludes all confusion, incivility, obstinacy,
clamours, and dissensions. Of the first kind, examples are
furnlshed by Paul ς as that profane banquets should not be
connected with the sacred supper of the Lord3 that women
should not appear in public without being veiled;(lt) and
many others in common use among us; such as, that we pray
with banded lmees and with our heads uncovered3 that we
administer the sacramenta of the Lord, not in a slovenly man·
ner, but with due decorum3 that we observa some decent
order in the burial of the dead; and other things of a similar
nature. Of the second sort are the hours appointed for public
prayers, sermons, and sacraments3 quietuess and silence un·
der sermons 3 the singing of hymns; the places appointed for
these services, and the days fixed for the celebrationes the

Lord's supper;(l) the prohibition of Paul, that women should
not teach in the Ohurch, and the like; but especially the
tegulations for the preservation of discipline, as catechizing‚
ecclesiastical censeres, excommunicatum fastings, and every
thing else that can be referred to the same class. Thus all the
