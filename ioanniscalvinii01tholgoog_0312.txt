be expressed with greater clearuess or precision. Peter, in
his own name and that of his brethren, had confessed that Christ
was “ the Son of God.’' (s) Upon this rock Christ builds his
Church, because it is the only foundation, as Paul says, “ other '’
thau which “can no man lay.'’ (g) Nor do I reject the au·
thority of the fathers in this case, from a want of testimonias
in their writings to support what Ι maintaiu, if 1 were inclined
to adduce them. But as Ihave observed,1am unwilling to
be unnecessarily tedious to my readers in arguing so cleara
subject; especially as it has been long ago discussed with
sufficient copiousuess and care by other writers ou our side of
the question.

Vll. Yet, in fact, we cau obtain uo better decisiou of this
point than from the Scriptura itself, if we compare all the places
where it shows what office and power Peter held among the
apostles, how he conducted himself, and iu what manner he
was received by thern. Ou an examination of the whole, we
shall only find that he wasone of the twelve, equal to the rest,
their companion‚ not their master. He proposes to the assembly
indeed, if there be any thing to be done, and delivers his opin-
ion on what is necessary to be done; but he hears the observa·
tious of others, and not only gives thern the opportunity of speak-
ing their sentimeuts‚ but leaves thern to decide, and when they
have determiued‚ he follows and obeys. (h) When he writes
to pastors, he does not command thern with authority like a
superior; but makes them his colleagues, and exhorts thern
with a courteousness which is usual among equals. (i) When
he is accused for having associated with the Gentiles, though
this is au unjust accusation, yet he answers it, and vindicatos
himself. (lc) Commended by his colleagues to go with John
to Samaria, he refuses not. (l) The apostles, by sending him,
declared that they did not consider him as their superior. By
his compliauce and undertaking the commission intrusted to
him, he confessed that he was a colleague with them, but had
no authority over thern. If none of these facts had remained
upon record, yet the Epistle to the Galatians might alone
easily remove every doubt3 where Paul devotos nearly two
whole chapters to the sole purpose of showing that he was
equal to Peter in the dignity of the apostleship. Hence he
relates that he went to Peter, not to profess subjection to him,
but to testify to all the hannony of their doctrine3 and that
Peter required no such thing as submission, but gave him the
right hand of fellowship, that they might labour together in
the vineyard of the Lord; that no less grace had been conferred
