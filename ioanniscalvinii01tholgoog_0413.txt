a superior. For what purpose? Not to exercise dominion, 1
apprehend. However highly we think of ourselves, therefore,
let us remember that we are appointed to a ministry not invest-
ed with a sovereignty. Learn that you want no sceptre, but a
pruning-knifc, to cultivate the Lord’sviueyard.'' Again: ‘⁸ lt is
plain that sovereignty is forbidden to the apostles. Go then, if
you dare, and sustaining the office of a temporal sovereign, usurp
the name of an apostle, or filling an apostolical office, usurp a
temporat sovereignty.'’ And immediately after: “ This is the
apostolic form: they are forbidden to exercise any dominion;
they are commanded to minister and serve.” Though all these
observatione of Bernard are evidently consistent with the truth,
and even though the true state of the case must be obvious to all
without any thing being said, yet the Roman pontifi was not
ashamed, at the Council ot' Arles, to decree, that the supreme
power of both swords belonged to him by Divine right.

XII. With respect to the donation of Constantine, persons
who have only a moderate acquaintance with the histories of
those times, need no insonnation how fabulous, and even ri·
dicnlous, this is. But to leave the histories, Gregory‚ who lived
above four hundred years after, is alone a competent and very
sufficient witness of this fact. For, wherever he speaks of the
emperor, he gives him the title of Most Serene Lord, and calls
himself his unworthy servant. In one place he says, ‘⁸ Let not
our lord, from his earthly power, be too ready to treat priests
with disdain 3 but with excellent consideration, for the sake of
him whose servants they are, let him rule over them in such a
manner, as at the same time to pay them due reverence.” We
see how, in the common subjection, he wished to be considered
as one of the people; for he is there pleading, not another
person’s cause, but his own. ln another place he says, “I trust
in Almighty God, that he will grant a long life to our pious
lords, and will govem us under your hand according to his
mercy.” lhave not quoted these passages with any dcsign to
discuss at large this question of the donation of Constantine,
but merely to show my readers, by the way, what a puerile
falsehood it is of the Romanists, to attempt to claim a temporal
sovereignty for their pontiff. And so much the more contempti-
ble is the impudence of Augustino Steuchus, the pope’s librarian,
who has had thc effrontery to prostitute his labours to serve his
master in such a desperate cause. Laurentius Valla had amply
refuted that fable, which was no difficulty to a man of learning
and an acute reasoner; yet, like a man little conversant in
ecclesiastical affairs, he had not said all that would have corrobo-
rated the argument. Steuchus sullies forth, and scatters the
most disgustiug trash to obscure the clear light. But, in fact, he
pleads the cause of his master with no more force than if some
