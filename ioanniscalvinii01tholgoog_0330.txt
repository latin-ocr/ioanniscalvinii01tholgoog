There are many such fooleries collected together by Gratian
without any judgment, which the Romanists in the present
day employ against us in defence of their see, and such phan-
toms with which they used to delude the ignorant in the dark-
est times, they still persist in bringing forward amidst all the
light of the present age. But 1 have no intention to devota
much labour to the refutation of such things, which manifestly
refute themselves by their extreme absurdity. Ι confess that
there are also genuine epistles of the ancient pontifis, in which
they extol the majesty of their see by the most magnificent
titles. Such are some epistles of Leo; who, though he was a
man of learning and cloquence‚ had likewise an immoderate
thirst for glory and dominion; but whether the Churches at
that time gave credit to his testimony when he thus exalted
himself, is a subject of inquiry. Now, it appears that many
were offended at his ambition, arrd resisted his claims. In one
epistle he deputes the bishop of Thessalonica to act as his re·
preseritative in Graece and other adjacent countries; in another
he delegatas the bishop of Arles, or some other bishop, to be
his vicar in France. So he appoints Hormisdas, bishop of
Seville, his vicar in Spain. But in all cases he mentions, by
way of exception, that he makes such appointments on condi·
tion that they shall in no respect infringe the ancient privileges
of the metropolitana But Leo himself declares this to be one
of their privileges, that if any difficulty should crisa, the metro·
politan was to be consulted in the first place. These delega-
tions, therefore, were accompanied with this condition -that
there was to be nc interference with any bishop in his ordinary
jurisdiction‚ with any metropolitan in hearing appeals, or with
any provincial synod in the regulation of the Ghurches. Now,
what was this but to abstain from all jurisdiction‚ and only to
interpose for the settlement of disputes, as far as was consistent
with the law and nature of ecclesiastical communion?

Xll. ln the time of Gregory, this ancient custom had already
undergone a considerable change. For when the empire was
convulssd and torn asundcr, when France and Spain wera
afflicted with repeated and numerous wars and distresses, llly-
ricum laid waste, Italy harassed, and Africa almost ruined
with incessant calamities, - in order to preserve the unity of the
faith amidst such a violent convulsion of civil affairs, or at least
to prevent its total destruction, all the bishops round about corr·
nected themselves more closely with the bishop of Rome. 'I'he
consequence was, that the power as well as the dignity of that
see was greatly increased. Ι am not much concerned, how·
ever, respecting the methods by which this was effected. Itis
at least evident, that it was greater at that period than in the
preceding ages. And even then it was very far from an un·
