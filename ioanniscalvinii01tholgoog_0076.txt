laugh,'’ who “lie on beds of ivory,’' who “ join field to field,”
who ‘¹ have the harp, and the lyre, and the tabret, and wine in
their feasts t '’ (s) Ivory and gold, arrd ricbes of all kinds, are
certainly blessings of Divine Providence, not only permitted,
but expressly designed for the use of men; nor arewe any where
prohibited to laugh, or to be satiated with food, or to annex
new possessions to those already enjoyed by ourselves or by our
ancestors, or to be delighted with musical harmony, or to drink
wine. This indeed is true; but amidst an abundance of all
things, to be immersed in sensual delights, to inebriate the
beart and mind with present pleasures, and perpetually to grasp
at new ones-these things are very remote from alegitimate use
of the Divino blessings. Let them bauish, therefore, immoderate
cupidity, excessive profusion, vanity, and arrogance ; that with

will have a rule for the legitimate enjoyment of them. On the
contrary, without this moderatiori, even common and ordina-
ry pleasures are chargeable with excess. For it is tmly ob-
served, that a proud heart frequently dwells under coarse and
ragged garments, and that simplicity and hnmility are sorne-
times concealed under purple and fine linen. Let all men, in
their respective stations, whether of poverty,ofcompetence, or of
splendour, live in the remembrance of this truth, that God confers
bis blessings on them for the support of life, not for luxury3 and
let them consider this as the law of Christian liberty, that they
leam the lesson which Paul had learned, when he said, “ 1 have
learned, in whatsoever state 1 aur, therewith to be content. 1
know both how to be abased, and 1 know how to abound: every
where and in all things I am instructed, both to be full and to be
hungry, both to abound end to suffer need.'' (t)

X. Many persons err likewise in this respect, that, as if their
liberty would not be perfectly secure unless witnessed by men,
they make an indiscriminate and imprudent use of it—a dis·
orderly practice, which occasions frequent offence to their weak
brethren. There are some to be found, in the present day,
who imagine their liberty would be abridged, if they were not
to enter on the enjoyment of it by eating animal food on Friday.
Their eating is not the subject of my reprehensi0n; but their
minds require to be divested of rh'is false notion; for they ought
to consider, that they obtain no advantage from their liberty
before men, but with God; and that it consists in abstinence
as well asin use. If they apprehend it to be immaterial in
God’s view, whether they eat animal food or eggs, whether
their garments be scarlet or black, it is quite sufficient. The
