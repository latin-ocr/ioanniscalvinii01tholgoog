III. On this point tums almost tbe whole argument os the
Epistle to the Galatians. For that they are enoneous ex·
positors, who maintain, that Paul there contende only for liberty
from ceremonias, may be proved srom the topica ot' his reasoning.
Such as these: “Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the
law, being made acurse sorus.’' (g) Again: “ Stand last, there·
fore, in the liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be
not entangled again with the yoke os bondnge. Behold,1 Paul
say unto you, that is ye be circumcised, Christ shall profit you
nothing. Every man that is circumcised isadebtor to do the
whole law. Christ is become os no effect unto you, whosoever
of you are justified by the law; ye are fallen from grace.'’(lt)
These passages certainly comprehend something more exalted
thane freedom from ceremonies. -I consess, indeed, that Paul
is there treating of ceremonias, because he is contending with
the false apostles, who attempted to introduce again into the
Christian Church tbe ancient shadows of the law, which had
been abolished by the advent os Christ. But for the decision

os this question it was necessary to discuss some higher topics, in
which the whole controversy lay. First, because the brightness
' of the gospel was obscured by those Jewish shadows, be shows
thatin Christ wc have a complete exhibition os all those things
which were adumbrated by the ceremonias of Moses. Secoudly,
because these impostors instilled into the people the very pemi-
cious opinion, that this ceremonial obedienco was sufficient to
merit the Divina favour, he principelly contends, that be-
lievers ought not to suppose that they can obtain righteousucss
before God by any works of the law, much less by those iu·
serior elements. And he at the same time toaches, that from
the condemnation os the law, which otherwise impende over all
men, they are delivered by the cross ot' Christ, that they may
rely with perfect security on him alone- a topic which properly
belongs to our present subject. Lastly, he asserts the liberty os
the consciences of believers, which ought to be laid under uo
obligation in things that are not necessary.

IV. The second part οἰ Christian liberty, which is dependant
on the first, is, that their consciences do not observo the law, as
being under any legal obligation3 but that, being liberated from
the yoke of the law, they yield a voluntary obedienco to the
will of God. For being possessed with perpetual terrors, as
long as they remain uuder the domiuion os the law, they will
never engage with alacrity and promptitude in the service os
God, unless they have previously received this liberty. We
shall more easily and clearly discover the design of these things
from an example. 'Phe precept of the law is, “Thou shalt
