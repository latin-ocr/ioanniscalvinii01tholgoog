111 This article os the creed, however, relates rn some
measure to the external Ghurch, that every one oi us may
maintain a brotherly agreement with all the children of God,
may pay due deference to the authority of the Ghurch, and, rn
a word ,may conduct himself as one of the flock. T'heret‘ore
we add vnn conuuurorv or sarnus-a clause which ,though
generally omitted by the ancients, ought not to be neglected,
because rt 'excellently expresses the character of the Ohurch3
as though rt had been said that the saints are united 1n the fel·
lowship os Christ on this condition, that whatever benefits God
confers upon them, they should mutually communicate to each
other. This destroys not the diversity of grace, for we know
that the gifts of the Spirit are variously distributed; nor does
it disturb the order os civil polity, which secures to every indi·
vidual the exclusive enjoyment of his property, aa it is neccs-
sary for the preservation of the peace of society that men
should have peculiar and distinct possessions. But the commu·
nity asserted is such as Luke describes, that “the multitude of
tliem that believed were of one heart and of one soul ;” (s)
aud Paul, when he exhorts the Ephesians to be “ one body,
and one spirit, even as they were called in one hope.'' (g)
Nor is it possible, is they are truly persuaded that God is a
common Father to them all, and Christ their common Hand,
but that, being united in brotherly affection, they should mu·
tually communicate their advantages to each other. Now, it
highly concernens to know what henefit we receive from this.
For we believe the Church, in order to have a certain assur·
auce that we are members ol it. For thus our salvation rests
on firm and solid inundatione so that it cannot fall into tuin,
though the whole fabric of the world should be dissolved.
hirst, it issounded on the electiori of God, and can he liable
to no variation or failure, but with the subversion ot' his etemal
providence. In the next place, it is united with the stability
of Christ, who will no more suffer his faithful people to bc
severed from him, than his members to bo torn in pieces.
BesideS, we ara certain, as longas we continue in the bosom
of the Church, that we shall remain in possession of tha truth.
Lastly‚ we understand these promises to belong to us: “In
mount Zion shall be deliverance.’' (h) God isin the midst of
her 3 she shall not be moved.'’ (i) Such is the effect oi union
with the Church, that it retains usin the fellowship of God.
