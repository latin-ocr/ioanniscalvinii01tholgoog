we do not obstruet their operation by any mortal sin. It is
impossible to express the pestilent and fatal nature of this
opinion, and especially as it has prevailed over a large part of
the world, to'the great detriment of the Church, for many ages
past. Indeed, it is evidently diabolical3 for by promising jus·
tification without faith, it precipitates souls into destruction: in
the next place, by representing the sacramenta as the cause of
justification‚ it envelops the minds of men, naturally too much
inclined to the earth, in gross superstition, leading them to rest in
the exhibitiones a corporeal object rather than in God himself.
Of these two evils Ι wish we had not had such ample experience
asto supersede the necessity of much proof. What is a sacra·
ment, taken without faith, but the most certain ruin of the
Church? For as nothing is to be expected from it, but in
consequence of the promise, which denotas God's wrath against
unbelievers as much as it offers his grace to believers, -the
person who supposes that the sacramenta confer any more upon
him than that which is offered by the word of God, and which
he receives by a true saith, is greatly deceived. Hence also it
may be concluded,that confidence os salvation does not depend
on the participation of the sacramentaria though that consti·
tuted our justification, which we know to be placed in Christ
alone, and to be communicated to us no less by the preaching
of the gospel than by the sealing of the sacramenta, aud that it
rnay be completely enjoyed without this participation So true
is the observation, which has also been made by Augustino,
that invisible sanclification may exist without the visible sign,
and, on the contrary, that the visible sign may be used without
real sanctification. For, as he also writes in another place,
“Men put on Christ, sometimes by the reception of a sacra-
ment, sometimes by sanctification of life.” The first case
may be common to the good and the bad3 the second is pecu·
liar to believers.

XV. Hence that distinction, if it be well understood, which
is frequently stated by Augustine, between a sacrament and the
matter of a sacrament. For his meaning is, not only that a
sacrament contains a figure, and some truth signified by that
figure, but that their connection is not such as to render them
inseparable 'from each other; and even when they are united,
the thing signified ought always to be distinguished from the
sign, that what belongs to the one may not be transferred to
the other. He speaks os their separation, when he observes,
that “the sacraments produce the effect which they represent,
in the elect alone. '' Again, when he is speaking of the Jews·
“ Though the sacramenta were common to all, tha grace which
is the power of the sacrament was not common; ao now, also,

the washing of reggrperation is common to all, ,Ἢ
