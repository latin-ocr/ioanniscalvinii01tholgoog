from which they will not be able to escape, but their misrepre·
sentations will be easily resuted. First3 By what oracla have
they obtained this solution, so inconsistent with the word os God ?
'l'he Scriptura mentions twelve who sat down with Jesus; but
it does not obscure the dignity of Christ so as to call them
sacrificing priests —a narne which I shall notice in the proper
place. Though he then gave the sacrament to the twelve,
yet he commanded that they should do the same; that is, that
they should distribute it among them in a similar manner.
Secondly; why, in that purer period, for almost a thousand
years aster the apostles, wera all, without exception, admitted
to the participation oi both symbols? Was the ancient Church
ignorant what guests Christ had admitted to his supper? Any
hesitation or evasion would betray the most consummate impu·
(lance. Ecclesiastical historias and works ol the fathers are
still extant, which surnish clear testimonias os this fact. 'Per-
tullian says, “ 'l'he flesh is fed with the body and blood ol
Christ, that the soul may be nourished by God.” Ambrose
said to Theodosius, “ With such hands how will you receive
the sacred body os the Lord? With what audacity will you
drink his sacred bloodl’' Jerome sayS, “The priests con·
secrate the eucharist and distribute the Lord's blood to the
people.” Chrysostom says, ‘³ lt is uot as it was under tha
ancient law, when the priest ate one part, and the peopla
another; but to all is presented one body and one cup. Every
thing in the eucharist iscommon to the priest and to the people.’‘
And the same is attested in various places by Augustine.
XLIX. But why do l disputo about a thing that is so
evident? Let any one read all the Greek and Latin fathers,
and he will lind them abound with such testimonias. Nor did
this custom sall into disuse while a particle of purity remained
in the Charch. Gregory, who may be justly called the last
bishop of Rome, shows that it was observed in his time. He
says, “ Yon have now learned what the blood os the lamb is,
not by hearing, but by drinking. His blood is drunk by the
saithsu1.” And it even continued for four hundred years aiter
his death, notwithstanding the universal degeneracy which had
taken place. Nor was it considered merely as a custom, but
as an inviolable law. For the Divina institution was then
reverenced, and no doubt was entertained os the criminality ot'
separating things which the Lord had united. For Gelasius,
bishop os Rome, speaks in the following marmor: “We have
understood that some, only receiving the Lord's body, ahstain

from the cup; who, as they appear to be enslaved by an unac-
countable superstition, should, without doubt, either receive the
sacrament entire, or entirely abstain from it. Fortissimus

this mystery can be made without great narii*
