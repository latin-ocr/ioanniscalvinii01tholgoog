therefore, rather fumishes an opposite argument: legal right·
eousness consiste in perfect works; no man can boast of having
satisfied the law by his works3 therefore there is no right»
eotnness by the law.

XIV. Our adversaries proceed to adduce those passages ιιι
which the faithful boldly offer their righteonsness ιο the ex·
amination of Divina justice, and desire to be judged according
to it. Such are the following: “ Judge me, Ο Lord, according
to my righteonsness, and according to mine integrity that isin
me.”(q) Again: “ Hear the right,OLord. Thou hast proved
mine heart3 thou host visited me in the night ; thou hest tried
me, and shalt find nothing.'’ (r) Again: “ 1 have kept the ways
of the Lord, aud have not wickedly departed from my God. 1
was also upright before him, and Ι kept myaelf from mine
iniquity. Therefore hath the Lord recompensed me according
to my righteonsness, according to the cleauuess of my hands.” (s)
Again: “ Judge me, Ο Lord, for Ι have walked ιιι ιιιιιιο iuteg-
rity. lhave not sat with vain persons; neither will I go iu
with dissemblers. Gather not my soul with sinuers, nor my
life with bloody men; in whose hands is mischief‚ aud their
right hand is full of bribes. But as for me, Ι will walk iumine
integrity.” (t) Ι have already spoken of the confidence which
the saints appear to derivo from their works. 'l'he passages
now adduced will form no objection to our doctrine, when they
are explained according to the occasion of them. Now, thisia
twofold. For believers who have expressed themselves ιιι
this manner, have no wish to submit to a general examination,
to be condemned or absolved according ιο the whole tenor of
their liveS, but they bring forward a particular cause to be
judgcd; and they attribute rightcousness to themselves not
with reference ιο the Divina perfectiori, but in comparison
with men of impious and abandoned characters ln tha
first place, in order to a man's being justified, it is requisito
that he should have, not only a good cause in some particular
instance, but a perpetual consistency of righteonsness through
life. But the saints, when they implore the judgmcnt of God
in approbationes their inuoccnce, do not present themselves as
free from every charge, and absolutely goddess, but having
fixed their dependence on his goodness alone, arrd confiding
m his readiness to avenge the poor who ara unlawfully aud
unjustly afflicted‚ they supplicate his regard to the cause ιιι
which the innocent are oppressed. But when they place them·
selves and their adversaries before the Diviue tribunal, they
boast notan innocence, which, on a severe exammation, would
