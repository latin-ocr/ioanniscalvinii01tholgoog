have auy existence.'’ lt is a poor cavil, to say that this passage
does not relate to the sacred supper, in which God exerta a
special power; because the question had been agitated respect·

ing the body of Christ, and this holy father, professedly an-
swering it, says, “Christ has given immortality to his body,
but has not deprived it of its nature. lu a corporeal form,
therefore, he is not to be considered as universally diffused5
for we must beware of asserting his Divinity in such away as
to destroy the truth of his body. lt does not follow, that, be-
cause God is every where, all that is in him is every where also.”
The reason is immediately added - “ For oue person is Gon aud
man, and both constitute one Christ ; as God, he is every where ;
as man,he is in heaven.’' What stupidity would it have be·
trayed not to except the mystery of the supper, a thing so serious
and important, is it contained any thing inconsistent with tha
doctrine he was maintaiuing! Yet, if any one will attentively
read what follows, he will find, that under that general doc·
trine, the Lord’s supper is also comprehended. He says, that
Christ, who is, in one person, the only begotten Son of God
and the Son of man, is every where present as Cod; that, as
God, he resides in the temple ofGod, that is, in the Church ; aud
yet that he occupies some particular place in heaven, according
to the dimensione of a real body. To unite Christ with his
Church, we see he does not bring down his body from heaveu3
which he certainly would have done, if that body could not
become our food without being enclosed under the bread. In
another place, describing how Christ is now possessed by be·
lievers, he says, “ You have him by the sign of the cross, by
the sacrament of baptism, by the food and drink of the altar.’'
Whether he is correct in placing a superstitious ceremouy
among the symbols os Christ’s presence, Ι am not now discuss-
ing ; but in comparing the presence of the flesh to the sign of the
cross, he sufficiently shows that he does not imagine Christ to
have two bodies, one visibly seated in heaven, aud the other
invisibly concealed under the bread. lf auy further explication
be necessary, it is soon aster added, “That we always have
Christ, according to the presence of his majesty; but that, ac·
cording to the presence of his flesh, it is rightly said, Me ye
have not always.” Our adversaries reply, that it is also ob·
served, at the same time, “that according to his ineffable and
invisible grace, his declaration is fulfilled - Lo,l arn with you
always, even to the end of the world.’' But this is nothing iu
their favour, because, after all, it is restricted to that majesty
which is always opposed to the body, and his flesh is expressly
distinguished from his power and grace. ln another passage
of this author, we find the same antithesis, or contrast, “that
Christ left his disciples iu his corporeal presence, that he might
