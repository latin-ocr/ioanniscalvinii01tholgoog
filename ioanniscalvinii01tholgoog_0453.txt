they were supposed to be tha only happy persons, who re·

to Christ. But 1 trust that the explication which tuave given
will be satisfactory to all good and peaceable persons, so asto
leave them in no doubt of the true meaning of Christ.

XIV. Nothing, however, was further from the intention of
the fathers, than to establish such a perfection as has since
been fabricated by these hooded sophisters, which goes to set
up two kinds of Christianity. For no one had then given birth
to that sacrilegious dogma, which compares the monastic pro·
fession to baptism, and even openly asserta it to be a species
of second baptism. Who can doubt that tha fathers would
have sincerely abhorred such blasphemy? As to tha conclu·
ding observation of Augustine‚ respecting the ancient monks,
that they devoted themselves wholly to charity, what need is
there for a word to be said to demonstrate it to be altogether
inapplicable to this modern profession? Tha fact itself de·
clares, that all who retire into monasterias separate themselves
from the Cburch. For do they not separate themselves from
the legitimare society of believers, by taking to themselves a
peculiar ministry and a private administration of the sacra·
ments? What is a disruption of the communion of the
Church, if thisbe not? And to pursne the comparison which
lhave commenced, and to conclude it at once, what resem-
blance havc they in this respect to the monks of ancient times?
'Phough they lived in astate of seclusion from other men, they
had no separate Church; they received the sacraments with
others3 they attended the solemn assemblies to hear preach·
ing, and to unite in prayers with tha company of believers;
and there they formed a part of the people. In erecting a
privata altar for themselves, what have tba present monks
done, but broken the bond of unity? For they have excom·
municated themselves fronr the general body of the Church,
and have shown contempt of the ordinary ministry, by which
it has pleased God that peace and charity should ba preserved
among his servants. All the present monasterias, therefore, l
maintain to be so manyconventiclesof schismatica, who disturb
the order of the Ohurch, and have been cut off from the legiti-
mate society of believers. And to place this division beyond
all doubt, they have assumed various names of sects; and
have not been ashamed to glory in that which Paul execratas

Ι beyond all possibilityof exaggeration. Unless we suppose that

Christ was divided by the Corinthians, when every one boasted
