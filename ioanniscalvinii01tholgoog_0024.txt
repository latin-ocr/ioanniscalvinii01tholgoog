says in another placo, that we are “the plauting of the Lord,
that he might be glorified.” (d) Our minds therefore will theu
be properly purified, when they shall iu no degree confide not
glory in our works But soolish men are led into such a false
and delusive confidence, by the error of always considerirrg
their works as the cause of their salvation.

XVII. But if we advert to the four kinds of causes, which
the philosophers direct usto consider in the productiori ofeffects,
we shall find none of them consistent with worlrs in the accom-
plishmeut of our salvation. For the Scriptum every where
proclaims, that the efficient cause of eternal life being procured
for us, was the mercy of our heavenly Father, and his gra·
tuitous love towards us; that the material cause is Christ aud
his obedicnoe, by which he obtained a righteousness for us;
and what shall we denominate the formal aud instrumental
eausa, unless it be faith? These three John comprehende iu
one sentence, when he says, that “ God so loved the world
that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.'' (e) The
final cause the apostle declares to be, both the demonstration of
the Divina righteousness aud the praise of the Divine goodness,
in a passage in which he also expressly mentions the other three
causes. For this is his language to the Romans: “All have
sinned, and come short of the glory of God, being justified
freely by his¹ grace : '' ( s ) here we bave the original source of
our salvatiou, which is the gratuitous mercy of God towards us.
It follows, “through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus : '²
here we have the matter of our justification. “ Through faitlr
iu bis blood: ’² here he points out the instrumental cause, by
which the righteousness of Christis revealed tous Lastly,
ho subjoins the end os all, when he says, “'I'o declara his
righteousness ; that he might be just, and the justificr of him
which believeth in Jesus.'’ And to suggest, by the way, that
this righteousness consists in reconciliation or propitiatiou, he
expressly asserta that Christ was “ set forth to be a propitiation.'’
So also iu the first chapter to the Ephesians, he reaches that
we are received into the favour of God through his mere marey 3
that it is accomplished by the mediation of Christ; that it is

seo that every part of our salvation is acdomplisbed without us,
⁸ what reason have we to confide or to glory in our works?
Nor can even the most inveterate enemies of Diviue grace raise
any controversy with us concerning the efficient or the final
