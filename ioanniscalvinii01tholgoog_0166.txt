we would be good, not that he himself would make us good.
This is not the language of him who says, ‘Ye have not cho·
sen me, but 1 have chosen you.'(d) For if he elected us
because he foreknew our future good, he must also have fore·
known our choice of him ; ’² and more to the like purpose.
This testimony should have weight with those who readily ac·
quiesce in the authority of the fathers Though Augustino
will not allow himself to be disunited from the rest, but shows
by clear testimonias the falsehood of that discordance, with the
odium of which he was loadcd by the Pelagians, he makes the
following quotations from Ambrose’s book on predestination:
“Whom Christ has mercy on, him hc calls. Those who
were indevout he could, if he would, have made devout.
But God calls whom he pleaseS, and makes whom hc will
religious.’' If I were inclined to compile a whole volume
from Augustino, 1 could easily show my readers, that Ineed
no words but his; but lam unwilling to burden them with
prolixity. But come, let us suppose them to be silent ; let us
attend to the subject itself. A difficult question was raised-
Whether it wasa just procedure in God to favour with his
grace certain particular persons. This Paul could have decided
by a single word, if he had pleaded the consideration of works.
Why, then, does henot do this, but rather continue his dis·
course involved in the same difficulty? Why, but from ne·
cessity? for the Holy Spirit, who spoke by his mouth, never
labourcd under the malady of forgetfulness. Without any
evasion or circumlocution, therefore, he answers, that God fa·
vours his elect because hc will, and has mercy because he will.
For this oracla, “l will be gracious to whom 1 will be gracious,
and will show mercy on whom 1 will show mercy,'’(e) is
equivalent to a declaration, that God is excited to mercy by no
other motivo than his own will to be merciful. 'l'he observa·
tion of Augustino therefore remains true, “ that the grace of
God does not find men fit to be elected, but makes them so.”

that with regard to us, it may in some sense be so called, ac·

when God is said to predestinata glory for man according to
merite, because he decreed to give him grace by which glory is
