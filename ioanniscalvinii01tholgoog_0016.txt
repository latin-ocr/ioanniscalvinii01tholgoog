vanity the Lord excellently refutes by the prophet. “Ask
now,’' saith he, “the priests, saying‚ If one bear holy flesh in

body touch any ol these, shall it be nucleari? And the priests
answered and said, It shall bc unclean. Then answered Hag-
gai, arrd said, So is this people, and so is this nation before
me, saith the Lord3 and so is every work os their hands ; and
that which they offer there is unolean.'’ (z) Iwish that this
passage might either obtain sull credit with 88, or 88 deeply
impressed on our memory. For there is no 888, however fla·
gitious his whole life rnay be, who can suffer himself to be
persuaded os what the Lord here plainly declares The great·
ost sinner, assoon as he has performed two or three duties os
the law, doubts not but they are accepted of him sor rightcous·
ness; but tho Lord positively denies that any sanctificationis
aequired by such actions, unless the heart bc previously well
purified; and not content with this, 88 asserts that all the
works of sinners are contaminated by the impurity of their
a hearts. Let the name of righteousness, then, no longer be given
to these works which are condemned for their pollution by the
lips os God. And by what 8 fine similitude does he demon·
strate this! For it might have been objected that what the
Lord had enjoined was inviolably holy. But 88 shows, on the
contrary, that it is not to be wondered at, if those things which
are sanctified by the law of the Lord, are defiled by the pollu-
tion of the wicked; since an unclean hand cannot touch any
thing that hasbeen consecrated, without prosaning it.

VIII. He excellently pursues the same argument also in
Isaiah: “ Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an 88818188-
tion unto me3 your new moons and your appointed foasts my
8881 hateth; they are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear
them. When ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
from you3 yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear:
your hands are fullos blood. Wash you, make you elean3 put
away the evil of your doings.’' (8) What is the reason that
the Lord is so displeased at an obedience to his law? But, in
fact, he here rejects nothing that arises from the genuine ob·
servance os the law3 the beginning os which, he every where
teaches, is an unseigned sear ol his name. (h) If that be want·
ing, 811 the oblations made to him are not merely trifles‚ but
nauseous and abominable pollutions. Let hypocritas go now,
and, retaining depravity concealed in their hearts, endeavour by
