not to worship him. Resides, if men require to be stimulated,
it is impossible to urge more lorcible arguments than those
which arise from the end oi our redemption and calling;
such as the word os God adduces, when it inculcates, that ir
is the greatest and most impious ingratitude not reciprocally to
“love him who first loved us; ’' (a) that “by the blood oi
Christ our consciences are purged from dead works, to serve
the living God 3 '’ (b) that it is ahorrible sacrilege, aiter having
been once purged, to defile ourselves with new pollutione, and
to profane that sacred blood; (c) that we have been “delivered
out of the hand of our enemies,’² that we “might serve him
without sear, in holiness and righteousness before him, all the
days os our life;''(d) that we are made “free from sin,'’
that with a free spirit we might “become the servants of
righteousness 3 ’' (e) “ that our old man is crucified,'’ that “ we
should welk in newness oi lise.'' (s ) Again: “ Is ye be risen
with Christ,’' as his members indeed are, “seek those things
which are above,” and conduct yourselves as “ pilgrims on the
earth ; ’' that yon may aspira towards heaven, where your
treasure is. (g) That “the grace of God heth appeared,
reaching us, that denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
world3 looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appear·
ing os the great God and our Saviour.” (Ιι) Wherefore “ (1οά
hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by
Christ.'' (i) 'l'hat we are the “templcs oi the Holy Ghost,’„’
which it is unlawsul to profane3 (lc) that we are not darkness,
“ but light in the Lord,'’ whom it becomes to “ walk as chil-
dren ol the light3 '' (1) that “God hath not called us unto
uncleanness, but unto holiness; sor this is the will of God,
even our sanctification‚ that we should abstain from fornica·
ti0n3 ”(m) that our calling isa holy one, which should be
followed by a correspondent purity os lile;(n) that we are
“made free from sin,'’ that we might “become servants of
righteousness.’'(o) Can we be incited to charity by any
stronger argument than that of John, “ ls God so loved us, we
ought also to love one another? ²² “in this the children os God
are manifest, and the children os the devii ; '' (p) hereby the
children of light, by their abiding in love, are distinguished from
the children of darkness3 or that os Paul, That is we be united
to Christ, we are members of one body, and ought to afford
each other mutual assistancelw) Or can we be more power·
