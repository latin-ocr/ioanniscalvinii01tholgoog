emancipated. Therefore, though they abstain from flesh, and
wear but one color, during all the rest 01 their lives, this is no
diminution 01 their freedom. Nay, because they are free, they
thereforeabstain withafree conscience. But they foll intoavery
pernicious error in disregarding the infirmity of their brethren,
which it becomes us to bear, so as not rashly to do any thing
which would give them the least offence. But it will be said,
that it is sometimes right to assert our liberty before men.
This 1 confess ; yet the greatest cantion and moderation must
be observed, lest we cast off all concern for the weak, whom
God has so strongly recommended to our regards.

Xl. 1 shall now, therefore, make some observatione cou-
cerning offences; how they are to be discriminated, what are to
be avoided, and what are to be disregarded3 whence we may
afterwards determine what room there is for our liberty iu our
intercourse with mankind. 1 approve 01 the common distinc-
tion between an offeuce given and an offence taken, since it is
plainly counteuanoed by Scriptura, aud is likewise sufficiently
significant 01 the thing intended to be expressed. If you do
any thing at a wrong timeor piace, or with an unseasonable
levity, or wantonness, or temerity, by which the weak and in·

ought 10 submit to the ignoranoe of weak brethren, but not at

Paul fully shows in many places. “ Him that is weak in the
