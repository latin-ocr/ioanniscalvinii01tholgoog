declares: whercfore it is corrupting the term by ashameful fiction
to restrict it to the age in which the gespel was published. By
saying that they were elected before the creetion 01 1110 world,
he precludes every consideration 01 merit. F'or what could be

some are separated frern others; ferit is evident, thet 011 ere

been “ cheren 11101 they might be hely,'’ fully refutes the error
which derives 01001100 from forelrnowledge; since Pau, 00 1110
