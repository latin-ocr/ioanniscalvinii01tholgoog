lifetime. ln the same sense must be understood what Paul
states in two places, that we are “ buried with Christ by bap-
tism.” (i) For he does not mean that he who isto be bap-
tized, must previously be buried with Christ, but simply de·
clares the doctrine which is contained iu baptism, and that to
persons already baptized; so that it would be nnreasonable to
argue srorn those passages, that such buria] with Christ must
precede baptism. In this manner Moses aud the prophets
reminded the pcople what was the meaning of circumcisiou,
though they had received that rite when they were infauts.
To the same effect is what Paul writes to tha Galaticus, that “ as
many as have been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ.'’ (lc)
For what purpose? Why, that they might thenceforward live
to Christ, who had never lived to him before. And though iu
adults a knowledge of the mystery ought to precede the recep-
tiou of the sign, yet a different mle is to be applied to insants,
as we shall presently show. Nor can any other conclusion be
drawn from that passage of Peter, which they consideras deci-
sivein their favour—that baptism is “not the putting away
of the filth of the flcsh, but the answer of a good conscience
toward God, by the resurrection of Jcsns Christ.” (l) 'l'hey
contend that this passage leaves not the least room for the
baptism of infants, who are not capable of that in which the
truth of baptism is here stated to consist. But they frequently
fall into this error, of maintainiug that the thing signified
should always precede the sign. For the truth of circumci-
sion also consisted iu tha same answer of agood conscience3
but if it ought of necessity to precede it, infanta would never
bave been circumcised by the command of God. But by
showing us that the answer of a good conscience is compre·
hended in the tmth of circumcision, aud at the same time
commanding infanta to be circumcised, he sufficieutly indicates
that it is administered with a view to something future.
Wherefore, all the present efficacy to bo required in the bap·
tism of infanta, is to ratify and confirm the covenant made
with them by the Lord. 'l'he remaining signification of this
sacrament will follow afterwards, at the time foreseen and ap-
pointed by the Lord.

XXll. lt must noW, Ι thinlr, be evident to every person, that
all arguments of this kind are mere perversioris of Scriptura.
'Phose which remaiu, and are nearly allied to these, we shall
run over in a cursory manner. They object, that baptism is
given for the remissiori of sins: this we admit, aud it is com·
plately in favour of our opinion. For being born sinuare, we
need pardou and remission eren from our birth. Now, as the
