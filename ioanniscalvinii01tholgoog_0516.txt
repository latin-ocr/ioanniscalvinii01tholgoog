cording to the first proposition, baptism ought to precede circum·
cision3 according to the second, it ought to followit. Yet it is
not a new thing for the minds of men to run into such incon-
sistencies, when they prefer their own dreams to the unerring
word os God. We say, therefore, that the first of these dif-
ferences is a mere dream. If they wished to allegoriae on the
eighth day, yet there was no propriety in this manner of doing
it. lt would have been much better to follow the ancients,
and refer the number of the day either to the resurrection of
Christ, which toolr place on the eighth day, and on which we
know that newness of life depends; or to the whole course of
the present lise, which ought to be a course of progressive mor·
tification, till, at the terminationes life, the mortification also
should be completed. Itis probable, however, that God de-
t'erred circumcision to the eighth day on account of the tender-

ness of young infante, whose lives might be endangered by the ’

performance of that rite immediately on their birth. Nor
is there much more solidity in the second position, that, after
being dead, we are buried by baptism3 since the Scrip-
ture expressly teaches, that ‘⁸ we are buried by baptism into
death,'’(t) in order to our entrance on a course of mortifi-
cation, and continuasse in it from that time forwerd! Nor is
there any more propriety in the objection, that, if it be neees-
sary to conform baptism to circumcision, women ought not to
be baptized. For if it be evident, that the sign ot‘ circumci-
sion testitied the sanctification of the seed of lsrael, there can
be no doubt that it was given equally for the sanctificatiorr of
males and semeles. And though only the males were circum-
cised, they alone being capable of it, the females were in a
certain sense partakers of their circumcision. Dismissing such
follies, therefore, letus never sorget the similarity of baptism
and circumcision, between which we discover a complete
agreement in the internal mystery, the promises, the use, and
the efficacy.

XVII. They consider themselves as advanciug a most pow-
erful argument for excluding infants from baptism, when they
allege, that by reason of their age they are not yet capable of
understanding the mystery signified in it; that is, spiritual re·
generation, which cannot talre place in early infancy. There-
fore they conclude, they are to be considered in no other view
than as children of Adam, till they have attained an age which
admits of a second birth. But all these things are uniformly
contradicted by the truth of God. For if they must be left

among the children of Adam, they are left in death} for in
Adam we carr only die. On the contrary, Christ commands
them to be brought to him. Why? Because he is life. To
