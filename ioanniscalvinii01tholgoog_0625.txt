answer, in the language of Augustino, “ 'I'hat sanctificationis
sometimes without the visible sacrament, and that the visible
sacrament is sometimes unaccompanied by internal sanctifica·

tion. ’² Again: “ That the sacrameuts effect that which they
represent in the elect alone.'’ Again: “That some persons
put on Christ as far as the reception of the sacrament, aad
others even to sanctification ς ” that the former is equally the
case with the good and evil 3 arrd the latter with none but the
good. Surely they have betrayed more than the wealrness of
children, and shown themselves blind to the broad day, wh0,
in the midst of such difficulty and perplexity, have not dis·
covered a thing so plain and obvious to every one.

XVII. Yet let them not flatter themselves, for in whatever
part they place their sacrament, Ι deny that it ought to be cou-
sidered as a sacrament at all; first, because it is not accom-
panied with any special promise of God, which is the only
foundation osa sacrament; secondly, because all the cere·
mony exhibited here is the mere inventiones men3 whereas
it has been already ascertained that sacramental ceremonias
cannot be instituted, except by God himself. All that they
have fabricated, therefore, respecting the sacrament of penance,
is nothing but falsehood and impostore. 'I'his counterfeit
sacrament they have adorned with a suitable title, calling it
“ a second plank after a shipwreck ; ’³ for that, if any oue by
sin has soiled the garment of innocence received in baptism,
he may purify it by penance. But this, they say, is the lau·
guage cf Jerome. Whose language soever it may be, it cannot
be exculpated from manifest impiety, if it be explained accord·
ing to their notion of it. As is baptism were effaced by sin,
and ought not rather to be recalled to the memory of the
sinner whenever he thinks of remissiori of sins, that it may
serve to comfort his mind, inspira him with courage, aad
confirm his confidence of obtaining the remissiones sins, which
was promised to him in baptism. But that which Jerome has
expressed with some degree of harshucss and impropriety, that
baptism, from which those who deserve to be exeommunicated
from the Ohurch have fallen away, is repaired by penitence,
these admirable expositors apply to their impiety. We shall
speak with the greatest propriety, therefore, is we call baptism
the sacrament of penitence3 since it is given for a confir·
matiou of grace, and seal of confidence, to those who meditate
repentance. And this must not be considered as an invention
of curs, for, beside its conformity to the language of Serip-
ture, it appears to have been generally received in the ancient
Ohurch as an indubitable axiam. For in the treatise on Faith
addressed to Peter, which is attributed to Angustiae, it is called
“the sacrament of saith and repentance.’' And why do we
