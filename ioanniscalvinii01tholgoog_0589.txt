XLV. These dearces were evidently passed by the holy
fathers with a view to retain aud perpetuata 1113 frequent cele·

. bration 01 the communion, which had been transmitted by the

apostles themselves, and which they pereeived to be highly
beneficial to believers, but by negligence 13 113 gradually sall·
ing into g'eneral disuse. Augustine testifies respecting the
age in which he lived, when he sayS, “The sacrament 01
this thing, 11131 is, 01 the nnity 01 the body 31 our Lord, is
prepared on the table of the Lord, iu some places daily, 111
other places on appointed days, 31 stated intervals of time;
and is thence received by some to life, by others to destruction.”
And in his first epistle to Januarius: “Some receive the body
and blood of the Lord every day, and others receive them 311
33113111 days, in some Churches, not a day passes without the
administration 31 the sacrament3 in others, it is administered
only on Saturdayand Sunday; and in others only 011 Sunday.”
But the pecple in general, being, as we have observed‚ some·
times too remiss, the holy fathers stimulated thern with severe
reproofs, that they might not appear to connive at such negli-
gence. 01 this we have an example in a homily 01 chrysos-
tom, on the Epistle to the Ephesians: ‘¹ To him who disho-
noured the feast, it is not said, Wherescre didst thou sit down?
but, How camest thou in hither? (q) Whoever is present here,
and is not a partaker os the mysteries‚ is wicked and impudent.
1 appeal to you, 11 any one be invited to a feast, and come,
wash his hands, sit down, and apparently make every prepa-
ration 101 partaking 31 it, and aster all teste nothing—will 113
1131 offer an insult both to the feast and to him who has pro-
vided it? So you, who appear among thern who, by prayer
prepare themselves to receive the sacred sood, who by 1113
very circumstance 01 1131 departing, confess yoursels to be one
01 their number, and after all do not participate with them,
would it not have been better sor you not 13 have made your
appearance among thern? Yon will tell me you are unworthy.
Neither then were you worthy 31 the communion 01 prayer,
which is a preparation 131 the receptiones the holy mystery.”

XLVI. Augustino and Ambrose unite in condemning the
practice which in their time had already been adopted in the
Bastern Churches, 131 the people 13 attend as spectatore 31 the
celebration 31 the sacrament, and not 1ο partake oi it. And
that cnstom, which enjoins believers to communicate only
once a year, is unquestionably an invention 01 the devil, who·
ever were the persons by whom it was introduced. lt is said
that Zepherinus, bislrop 01 Rome, was the author 31 11131 (13-
cree; which there is not the least reason 101 believing 13 have
