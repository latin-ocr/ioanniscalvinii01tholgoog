poars how very displeasing this situation was to Gregory. For
be frequently complains, that under the name of being a bishop‚

be was forced baclr to the world, aud that he was more in-
volvcd in secular cares than ever he had been while he was a
layman3 so that in that honour he was oppressed with the
tumult of worldly business In another passage he says,
“Such a vast burden of occupations presses me down, that my
mind is incapacitated for any elevation towards things above.
larn tossed about with numerous causes, like so many waves3
and after my former seasons of retirement aud tranquillity‚ I am
disquieted with the tempests of a tumultuous life3 so that 1
may truly say,I arn come into the depth of the sea, and the
ternpest has drowned me.'’ J udge, then, what he would have
said, if he bad fallen upon these times. If he did not fulfil the
office of a pastor, yet be was employed in it. He refrained
from all interference iu the civil goverument, and aclrnow-
ledged himself to be subject to the emperor in common with
others. He never intruded into the care of other Ghurches,
except when he was constrained by necessity. And yet he
considered himself to be in a labyrinth, because be could not
wholly devote himself to the exclusive duties of a bishop.

stated, was at that tirno engaged in a contest with the bisbop
of Rome, respecting the primacy. For aster the seat of the
empire was fixed at· Constantinople, the majesty of the govern-
ment seemed to require that Ghurch to bo the next in dignity to
the Ghuroh of Rome. And indeed at the beginning nothing
contributcd more to establish the primacy in the Ghurch of Roma
than the circumstance of that city being then the capital of the
empire. Gratian recites a rescript under the name of Pope Lu·
cinus, in which hc says that the distinction of citios appointed
to be the residenee of metropolitans and primates, was regulated
by no other rulo than the nature of the civil government previ·
ously established in theru. 'I'here is another similar rescript,
also, under the name of Pope clement, in which he says, that
patriarcha had been appointed iu those cities which had anciently
been the statione of arch-damona. This statement, though er·
roneous, approaches to the truth. For it is certain, that iu
order to make as little change as possible, the provinces were
divided according to the existiug state of things, and that
primates and metropolitana were placed in those citios which
had precedence of the rest in dignity and power. Therefore,
in the Gouncil of Turin, it was decreed, that those which were
the chief citios ol the respective provinces in the civil govern-
ment, should be the priucipal sees of bishops; and that if the
honour of the civil govemmeut should happou to be transferred
from one city to another, the seat of the metropolitan should ho
