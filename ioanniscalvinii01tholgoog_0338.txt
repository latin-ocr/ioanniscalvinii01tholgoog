who only choose to open their eyes. But tlre Decretal Epis
tles, complied by Gregory the Ninth, as well as the Constitu·
tions of clement the Fifth, and the Decrees of Martin, still
more openly and expressly betray, in every page, tha inhumari
ferocity and tyranny of barbarous kings. But these ara the
oracles from which the Romanists wish their Papacy to be
appreciated. Hence proceeded those famous axioma, which at
the present day are universally received by them aa oracles:
'I'hat the pope cannot err; that the pope is superior to all
councils; that the pope is the universal bishop of all Churches,
and supreme head of the Ghurch upon earth. 1 poss over tha
far greater absurdities, which foolish canonista maintain in
their schools; which, however, the Roman theologians not
only assent to, but even applaud, in order to flatter their idol.
XXI. 1 shall not treet them with all the severity which
they deservo. 'I'o this consummate insolence, another person
would oppose the declarationes cyprian among the bishops at
the Gouncil of Carthage, of which he was president: “No one of
us calls himself bishopof bishops, or, by tyrannical fear, constrains
his colleagues to the necessity of obeying him.” He would
object what was decreed at Carthage sometime after, “ That
no one should be called prisce of priests, or first bishop.'’ He
would collect many testimonies from historias, many canons
of councils, and various passages from tha writings of the fa·
there, by which the Roman pontiff would be reduced to the
rank of other bishops. l pass over these things, however, that
lmay not appear to lay too much stress upon them. But let
the most able advocates of the Roman see answer me, with
what face they can dare to defend the title of anivmsol bishop,
which they find to have been so often anathematized by Gregory.
If the testimony of Gregory be entitled to any credit, they can-
not malre their pontifi universal bishop without thereby declar·
ing him to be Antichrist. Nor was the title of head any more
in use at that time; for in one of his epistles he says, “Peter
is the principal member in the body; John, Andrew, and
James, were heads of particular people. Yet they are all
members of the Church under one head. Even the saints
before the law, the saints under the law, the saints under grace,
are all placed among the mambers, and no one ever wished
himself to be called automata The arrogant pratensions of
the pontiff to the power of commanding are very inconsistent
with an observation made by Gregory in another passage. For
when Eulogius, bishop of Alexandria, had represented himself
as commanded by him, he replies in the following manner : -
“ 1 beseech you, let ma not hear the word mwunond mentioned
again3 for 1 lrnow what Iam, arrd what you are. In station,
you are my brethren3 in holiness, you are my fathers. Thara-
