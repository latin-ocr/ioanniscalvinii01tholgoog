examine another, or every one to examine the whole Ghurch,
but each individual to prove himself. If it were unlawful to
communicate with an unworthy person, Paul would certainly
have enjoined usto look around us, to see whether there were
not some one in the multitude by whose impurity we might be
contaminated. But as he only requires every one to examine
himself, he shows that it is not the least injury to us if some
unworthy persons intrude themselves with us. And this is
fully implied in what he afterwards subjoins: “ He that cateth
and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinlreth judgrnent to
himself.'’ (c) He says, not to others, but to himself, and with
sufficient reason. For it ought not to be left to the judgment
of every individual who ought to be admitted into the Church,
and who ought to be expelled from it. This authority belongs
to the whole Ohurch, and cannot be exercised without legitimate
order, as will be stated more at large hereafter. lt would be
unjust, therefore, that any individual should be contarninated
with the unworthiness of another, whose approach it is neither
in his power nor his duty to prevent.

XVI. But though this temptation sometimes arises even to
good men, from an inconsiderate zeal for righteousness, yet we
shall generally find that excessive severity is more owing to
pride and haughtiness, and a false opinion which persons enter·
tain of their own superior sanctity, than to true holiuess, aud a
real concern forits interests. Those, therefore, who are most
daring in promoting a separation from the Ohurch, aud act, aa
it were, as standard-hearers in the revolt, have in general uo
other motive than to make an ostentatious display of their own
superior excellence, and their contemptos all others. Augustino
correctly and judieiously observes — “ Whereas the pious mle
and method ofecclesiastical discipline ought principally to regard
the unity of the Spirit in the boud of peace, which the apostle
enjoined to be preserved by mutual forbearance, and which not
being preserved, the mediciual punishment is evinced to be not
only superfluous, but even pernicious, and therefore to be no
longer medicina13 those wicked children, who, not from a
hatred of the iniquities of others, but from a fondness for their
own contentions, earnestly endeavour to draw the simple and
uninformed multitude wholly after them, by entangling them
with boasting of their own characters, or at least to divide them,
those persons, Ι say, inflated with pride, infuriated with obsti·

raising seditions, conceal themselves under the mask ofa rigid se-
verity, lest they should be proved to be destitute of the truth;
