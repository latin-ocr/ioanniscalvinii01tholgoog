ol Babylon and live.” (a) We see what great obediende and
honour the Lord required to be rendered to that pestilent and
cruel tyrant, for no other reason thau because he possessed the
kingdom; and it was by the heavenly decree that he was
seated on the throne of the kingdom, and exalted to that regal
majesty, which it was not lawful to violate. Is we have this
coustantly present to our eyes and Impressed upon our hearts,
that tho most iniquitous kings are placed on their thrones hy
the same decree by which the authority os all kIngs is esta·
blished‚ those seditious thoughts will never enter our minds,
that a king is to be treated according to his merita, and that it
is not reasonable for us to be subject to a king who does not
on his part perform towards us those duties which his office
requires.

XXVIII. ln vaIn will any one object that this was a special
command given to the Israelites. For we must observe the
reason upon which the Lord founds it. He says, “I have
given these lands to Nebuchadnezzar3 therefore serve hiur
and live.” Tc whomsoever‚ therefore,a kingdom shall evi·
dently be given, we have no room to doubt that subjection is
due to him. And assoon as he exalts any person to royal
dignity, he gites us a declaration of his pleasure that he shall
reign. The Scriptura contains general testimonias on this
subject. Solomon says, “For the transgression os a land,
many are the priuces thereof.'' (y) Job says, “ He looseth the
bonds os kings,” or divests them os their power ; “ and girdeth
their loins with a girdle,” (z) or restores thern to their former
dignity. This being admitted, nothing remeius sor us but to
serve and lite. 'I'he prophet Jeremiah likewise records another
command os the Lord to his people: “ Seek the peace of the
city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and
pray unto the Lord for it 3 for iu the peace of it ye shall have
peace.”(a) Here, we see, the Israelites, aster having been
stripped of all their property, torn from their habitatione, driven
into exile, and forced into a miserable servitude, were com-
manded to pray for the prosperity os their conqueror ; not in
the same manner in which we are all commanded to pray lor
our persecutors; but that his kingdom might be preserved in
sasety and tranquillity, and that they might live in prosperity
under him. Thus David, after having been already designated
as king by the ordination of God, and anointed with his holy
oil, though he was nujustly persecuted by Saul, without having
given him any cause os offeuee, nevertheless accounted the
person os his pursuer sacred, because the Lord had consecrated
