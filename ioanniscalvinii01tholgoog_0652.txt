honour; nor can the violence os the wicked be restrained, un·
less crimes are followed by severe punishments. And these
two parts are included iu the injunction of the prophet to kings
and other governors‚ to “executa judgment and righteous·
ness.’' (d) Rigbteousness means the care, patronage, deleme,
vindication‚ and liberation of the innocent: judgmeut imports
the repression of the audacity‚ the coercion os the violence, and
the punishment os the crimes, os the impious.

X. But herc, it seems, arises an important and difficult ques-
tion. lt by the law os God all Christiana are forbidden to kill, (e)
and the prophet predicte respecting the Church, that “they
shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain, saith the
Lord, '’(s) how can it be compatible with piety for magis-
trates to shed blood? But is we understand, that in the in·
fliction os punishments, the magistrate does not aot at all from
himself, but merely executes the judgments os God, we shall
not be embarrassed with this scruple. The law of the Lord
commands, “ Thou shalt not kill;'' but that homicide may

not go unpunished, the legislator himself puts the sword into ,

the hands of his ministers‚ to be used against all homicides. (g)
To burt and to destroy are incompatible with the characteres
the godly; but to avenge the affiictions of the righteous at
the command os God, is neither to burt nor to destroy. There·
sore it is easy to conclude that in this respect magistrates are
not subject to the common law; by which, though the Lord
binds the hands os men, he does not bind his own justice, which
he exercises by the hands os magistrates So, when a prinee
forbids all his subjecte to strike or wound any one, he does not
prohibit his officers from executing that justice which is par·
ticrdarly committed to them. 1 sincerely wish that this con·
sideration were constantly in our recollection,lthat nothing is
done here by the temerity of men, but every thing hy the
authority of God, who commands ir, and under whose guidanoe
we never err srom the right way.) For we can find no velid
objection to the infliction os public vengeance‚ unless the jus-
tice of God bc restrained from the punishment of crimes. But
if it be unlawsrd for us to impose restraints upon him, why do
we calumniate his ministers? Paul says of the magistrate,
that “ He beareth not the sword in vain3 sor he is the minis·
ter os God, a revenger to executa wrath upon him that doeth
evil.’' (b) Theresore, is princes and other governors know that
nothing will be more acceptable to God than their obedience,
and if they desire to approve their piety, justice, and integrity
before God, let them devote themselves to this duty. 'ruis
