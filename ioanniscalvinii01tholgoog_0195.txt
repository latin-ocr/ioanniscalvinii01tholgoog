generation os them that seek him, that seek thy sace, Ο

that they may not be disturbed by lshmselites being united
with thenr in the Ghurch, since the mask will at length be torn
off, and they will be cast out with disgreoe.

lX. The same reosoning applies to the exception lately cited,
where Christ says, thet “none ot' them is lost, but the son of
perdition.” (e) Here is, indeed, some inaccuracy of expression,
but the meaning is clear. For he wes never reckoned among
the sheep oi Christ, as being really such, but only as he occu-
pied the place os one. When the Lord declares he was chosen
by himself with the other opostles, it only refers to the minis·
terial office. “ Have not l chosen you twelve,” says he, “ and
one of you is a devil?”(s) Thet is, he had chosen him to
tho office of en epostle. But when he speaks of election to
salvation, he excludes him from the number of the elect: “l
speak not of you sll; lknow whom rusve choscn.’'(g) Is
any one confound the term motion in these passages, he will
misersbly embarrass himself ; if he make s proper distinction,
. nothing is plainer. It is therefore a very erroneous and per·
nieious essertion of Gregory, that we are only conscious os our
calling, but uncertain oi our electi0n; from which he exhorts
all to sear and trembling, using slso this argument, that though
we know what wo are today, yet we know not what we may
be in future. But the context plainly shows the cause of his
error on this point. For as he suspended election on the merit
of works, this furnished abundant reason sor discouragemeut to
the mindo ot' men: he could never establish them, for want ot'
leading them from themselves to a confidenoe in the Divino
gocdness. Hence believers hove some perception os what we
stated at the beginning, thet predestinaticn, rightly considered,
neither destroys nor weakens saith, but rather fumishes its best
confirmation. Yet l will not deny, thet the Spirit sometimes
accommodares his language to the limited extent oi our capacity,
as when he soys, “They shall not be in the assembly os my
&tntilli litteratissimum trent
book oi lise those whomghe numbers among his people, whereas
we know from the testimony of Christ, that the names os God's
children haye been written in the book os life irom the begin·
ning.(s') But these expressions only signisy the rejection os
those who seemed to be the ehies among the elect 3 ss the
Psalmist says, “ Let them be blotted out oi the book of the
living, and not be written with the righteous.'’ (lc)
