God employs in his govemment of the Ohurch, is the principcl
bond which holds believers together in one body. He also
indicates that the Ohurch cannot be preserved in perfect safety,
unless it be supported by these means which God hasbeen
pleased to appoint for its preservation. Christ, he says, “as-
cended up far above all heavens, that he might fill all things.’' (c)
And this is the way iu which he does it. By means of his
ministers, to whom he has committed this office, and on whom
he has bestowed grace to discharge it, he dispenses and distri·
butes his gifts to the Ohurch, and even affords some manifesta·
tion of his own presence, by exerting the power of his Spirit in
this his institution, that it may not be vain οι ineffectual.
Thus is the restoration of the saints effected; thus is the body
of Christ edified3 thus we grow up unto him who is our Head
in all things, and are united with each other, thus we are all
brought to thc unity of Christ3 if prophecy flourishes among
us, if we receive the apostles, if we despise not the doctrine
which is delivered to us. Whoever, therefore, either ainis to
abolish or undervalue this order, of which we are treating, and
this species of govemment, attempts to disorganize the Ohurch,
or rather to subvert and destroy it altogether. For neither the
light and heat of the sun, nor any meat and drink, arc so neces-
sary to the nourishment and sustenance of the present life, as the
apostolical and pastoral office is to the preservation of the Ohurch
in the world.

111. Therefore 1 have already remarked, that God has fre-
quently commended its dignity to us by every possible enco-
mium, in order that wc might hold it in the highest estimation
and value, as more excellent than every thing else. That he
confers a peculiar favour upon men by raising up teachers for
them, he fully signifies, when he commands the prophet to
exclaim, “How beautiful are the feet of him that publisheth
peace ; '' (d) and when he calls the apostles “the light of the
world,'' and “the salt of the earth.'’ (e) Nor could that office
bc more splendidly distinguished than when he said to thern,
“ He that heareth you, heareth me.'' (f) But there is no
- passage more remarkable than that in Paul ’s Second Epistle to
the Corinthians, where he professedly discusses this question.
He contends, that there isnothing more excellent or glorious
than the ministry of the gospel iu the Ohurch, inasmuch as
it is the ministration of the Spirit, and of righteousness, aud of
eternal life. (g) The tendency of these and similar passages, is
to preserve that mode of governing the Ohurch by its ministers‚
which the Lord appointed to be of perpetual continuance, from
