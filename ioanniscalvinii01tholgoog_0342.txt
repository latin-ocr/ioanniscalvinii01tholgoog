, from the time when it began to be the seat of Antichrist, it has
oeased to be what it was before.

XXV. Some persons think us too severe aud censorious,
when we call the Roman pontiff Antichrist. But those who
are of this opinion do not consider that they bring the same
charge of presumption against Paul himself, after whom we
speak, and whose language we adopt. And lest any one should
object, that we improperly pervert to the Roman pontiff those
words of Paul, which belong to a different subject,l shall briefly
show that they are not capable of any other interpretation than
that which applies thern to the Papacy. Paul says, that Anti·
christ “sitteth in the temple of God.'’ (z) In another place,
also, the Holy Spirit, deseribing his image in the person of
Antiochus, declares that his kingdom will consist in “speaking
great words,” or blasphemias, “against the Most High.’'(o)
Hence we conclude, that it is rathere tyranny over the souls of
men, than over their bodies, which is erected in opposition to
the spiritual kingdom of Christ. And in the next place, that
this tyranny is one which does not abolish the name of Christ
or of his Ohurch, but rather abuses the authority of Christ, and
conceals itself under the character of the Churoh, as under a
mask. Now, though all the heresias and schisma which have
existed from the beginning belong to the kingdom of Antichrist,
yet when Paul predicts an approaching apostasy, he significo
by this description that that seat of abomination shall then be
erected, when anniversal defection shall hare seized the Church,
notwithstanding many members‚ dispersed indifferent places,
persevera in the unity of the faith. But when he adds, that even
in his days “ the mystery of iniquity '' did “already work '' (b)
in secret what it was afterwards to effect in a more publio
manner, he gives us to understand that this calamity was neither
to be introduced by one man, nor to terminate with one man.
Now, when he designatas Antichrist by this character, - that ho
would rob God of his honour in order to assume it to himself, .-
this is the principal indication which we ought to follow in our
inquiries after Antichrist, especially where such pride proceeds
to a public desolation of the Ghurch. As itis evident therefore
that the Roman pontiff has impudently transferred to himself
some of the peculiar and exclusive prerogatives of God and
Ohrist, it cannot be doubted that he is the captain and leader
of this impious and abominable kingdom.⁴

XXVI. Now, let the Romanists go and object antiquity
against ns; as if, in such a subversion of every thing, the
honour of the see could remain, where no see exista. Euse-
bius relatas that God, in order to make way for hio vongeance,
