XI. First, let us hear by what arguments they prove this
authority 10 have been given to the Ohurch5 and then we shall
see how far their allegatione respecting the Church contributa
to support their cause. The Ohurch, they say, has excellent
promises, that she is never 10 be lorsaken by Christ, her spouse,
but will be led by his Spirit into all truth. (p) But 01 the pro·
mises which they are accustomed to allega, many are given
no 101110 each believer iu particular, than collectively to
the whole Chumh. For though the Lord was addressing the
twelve apostles when 110 said, “Lo, l am with you alway,
even uuto the end 01 the world;”(q) and “l will pray the
Father, and he shall give you another comforter, even the
Spirit 01 truth ; '' (r) he made these promises not only 10 the
apostles considered as a body, hut to every one 01 the number,
and even 10 the other disciples whom he had already received,
or who were afterwards to be added to them. Now, when
they interpret these promises, replete with peculiar consolation,
in such a sense as 11 they were given to 110 individual Christ·
ian, but only to the whole Church collectively, what is this
but depriving all Christiana 01 the confidence with which such
promises ought to animate them? Here 1 do not deny that
the whole society 01 believers, being adorned with a manifold
variety 01 gifts, possesses amore ample and precious treasure
0111001011111 wisdom, than each particular individua13 nor do 1 y
intend that these things are spoken 01 believers in common, as
if they were all equally endued with the spirit 01 understand·
ing and 1100111110; but we must not allow the adversaries 01

» Christ, in defence 01 a bad cause, 10 wrest the Scriptura to a

sense which it was not intended 10 convey. leaving this
remark, l sreely ackuowladge that 1110 Lord is contiuually pre·

that this is 1101 a spirit 01 01101, ignorance, salsehood, or dark-

110111 whom they may certainly learn “the things that are
given to '’ them“ 01 God,’' or, in other words, “may know
what is the hope 01 his calling, and what the riches 01 the
glory 01 his inheritanca in the saints.” (s) But as it is nothing
more than the first fruita, a kind 01 1010111110 01 that Spirit that
