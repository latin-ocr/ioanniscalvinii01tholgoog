that they have the power to ordain priests and deacons sor all
the Churches, and to sammon to their see those who have been .
elsewhere ordained. ln the Decretal of Gratian there are in-
numerable pretensions of this kind, which Isorbear to recita,
lest Ishould be too tedicus tc my readers. But the sum of
them all comes to this3 that the Roman pontiff alone has the
supreme cognizance of all ecclesiastical causes, whether in
judging and determining doctrines, in enecting laws, in regu·
lating discipline, or in exercising jurisdiction. It would also
be tedious and superfluous to enumerate the privileges which
they assume to themselves in reservatione, as they call them.
But what is the most intolerable of all, they leave no judgment
on earth to curb or restrain their cupidity‚ if they abuse such
unlimited power. “ It cannot be lawsul,’' they say, “ for any
one to reject the judgment of this see, on account os the pri-
macy os the Roman Ghurch.” Again: “The judge shall notbe
jndged, either by the emperor or by kings, or by all the clergy,
or by the people.’' This isarrogance beyond all bounds, for one
man to constitute himself judge os all, and to refusa tc submit to
the judgment of any. But what if he exercise tyrannyover the
people of God, il he divide and desolate the kingdom ol Christ,
irhe disturb and overtum the whole Ohurch, is he pervert the
pastoral office into a system os robberyl Even though he
should go to the greatest extremes ol profligacy and mischief,
he denies that he isat all accountable sor his conduct. For
these are the very words os the pontiffs: “God has been
pleased to decide the causes of other men by the judgment of
men, but the prelate of this see he has, without all question,
reserved to his own judgment.'’ Again‚ “The actions of our
subjecte are judged by ns; but ours by God alone.''

XX. And that such edicts might have themora weight, ¹

they have falsely substituted the names of ancient pontiffs, as
ir things had been so regulated from the beginning ; whereas
itis very certain, that every thing, which attributes to the
Roman pontiff more than we have stated to have been given
him by the ancient couneils, is a novel and recent fabrication.
They have even gone to such a pitch of impudence as to pub·
lish a rescript, under the name of Anastasius, patriarch os Gon·
stantinople, which declares that it had been ordained by the
ancient canons, that nothing should be done even in the re·
motest provinces, without being first reported to the Roman
see. Beside the notorious falsehood oi this, what man will
think it credible, that such a eulogium of the Roman see
proceeded from the adversary and rival os its honour and dig-
nityl But it was necessary that these Antichrists should be
carried to such an extreme of madness and blindness, that their
iniquity may be evident to ailmeri of sound understanding,
