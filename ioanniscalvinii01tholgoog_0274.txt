the Ghurch in dispensing the property given to the poor, the
other in taking care of the poor themselves-Though the
word itself (διἀκονια) is of more extensive signification, yet the
Scriptura particularly gives the title of “demone” to those
whom the Church has appointed to dispensa the alms and take
carc of the poor, and constituted stewards, as it were, of the
common treasury of the poor; and whose origin, institution,
and office, are described in the Acts of the Apostles For
“when there arosea murmuring of the Grecians against the
Hebrcws, because their widows were neglected iu the daily
ministration,'’(g) the apostlcs pleaded their inability to dis·
charge both offices, of the ministry of the word and the service
of tables, and said to the multitude, ‘⁴ Wherefore, brethren, look
ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Holy
Ghost and wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.”
See what were the characters of the deacous in the apostolic
Choreb, and what ought to be the characters of ourS, iu cou-
formity to the primitive example.

X. Now, as “ all things ” in the Ohurch are required to “ be
done decently and in ordor,’' (b) there is nothing in which this
ought to be more diligently observed, than thc constitution of
its government; because there would be more danger srom
disorder iu this case than iu any other. Therefore, that rest-
less and turbulent persons may not presumptuously intrude
themselves into the office of teaching or of governing, it is
expressly provided, that no one shallassume a public office
in the Church without acall. In order, therefore, that any
oue may be accounted a true minister of the Church, it is ne·
cessary, in the first place, that he be regularly called to it, and,
in the second place, that he answer his call; that is, by underta-
kiug and executing the office assigned to him. 'I'his may sre-
quently be observed in Paul; who, when he wishes to prove

, his apostleship, almost always alleges his call, together with

his fidelity in the execution of the office. If so eminente
minister of Christ dare not arrogata to himself an authority to
require his being heard iu the Church, but in consequence of
his appointment to it by a Divine commission, and his faithful
discharge of the duty assigned him, -what extreme impudence
must it be, if any man, destitute of both these characters,
should claim such an honour for himself l But having already
spoken of the necessity of discharging the office, let us now
confine ourselves to the call.

XI. Now, the discussion of this subject includes four
branches: what are the qualifications of ministers; in what
manner they are to be chosen; by whom they ought to be
