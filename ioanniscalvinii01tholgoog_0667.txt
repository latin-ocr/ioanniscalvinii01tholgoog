said, “The most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father

a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour; and 1011113
majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languageS,
trembled and 1331311 before him.''(o) When we hear that
Nebuchadnezzar was placed on the throne by God, let 113,
31 1113 same time, call to mind the celestial edicte which
command us to sear 31111 honour the king3 and we shall not

hesitate 10 regard the most iniquitous tyrant with the honour ’

11113 101113 station in which the Lord has deigned to place
him. When Samuel denounced to the children 01 131331 what
treatment they would receive from their kings, 113 said, “This
will be 1113 manner* 01 1113 king that shall reign over you ; he
will take your sons 31111 appoint them 101 himself, 101313
chariots, and to be his horsemen, and to 3311113 ground, and to
reap his harvest, and to make his instrumenta 01 war. And he
will take your daughters to be consectionaries‚ and to 33 cooks‚
and to be bakers. And he will take your fields, and your vine-
yards, and your oliveyards, even the best 01 them, 3ηά give them
to his servants. And he will take 1113 tenth 01 your seed, and
01 your vineyards, and give to his officere and to his servants.
And he will take your men-servants, and your maid-servants,
and your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them
to his work. Η3 will take the tenth 01 your sheep; and ye
shall be his servants.” (ro) Certainly the kings would not do
all this by “right'’ 101 they were excellently instructed by
the law to observo 311 moderation; but it was called a “right ’'
with respect to the people who were bound 10 obey, 31111 were
not at liberty to resist it. lt was justas 11 Samuel had said,
The cupidity of your kings will proceed 10311 these outrages,
which it will 1101 33 your province to restrain; nothing will
remain 101 you, but to receive their commanda and to obey
them.

XXVII. But the most remarkable and memorable passage
01 311 13 111 1113 Prophecy 01 Jeremiah, which, though it is rather
long, Ishall readily quote, because it most clearly decides the
whole question: “l have made 1113 earth, the man and the
beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my
outstretched arm, and have given it unto whom it seemed meet
unto me. And now 111313 given 311 13333 1311113 11110 1113 1131111
01 Nebuchadnezzar, the king 01 Babylon, my servant. And all
nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son’s son, until 1113
very time of his land come. And it shall corne to pase, that
the nation and kingdom which will not 33113 1113 331113 king
01 Babylon, that nation will l punish with the sword, and with
the famine, and with the pestilence. 'Pherefore serve the king
