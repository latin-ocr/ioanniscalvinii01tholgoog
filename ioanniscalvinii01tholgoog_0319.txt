serves, or rather to admit the validity of the ordinance of the
Holy Spirit, it becomes us rather to loolr up to the apostleship
of Paul than to that of Peter. For their different provinces
were allotted to them oy the Holy Spirit, who sent Peter to
the Jews, and Paul to us. The Romanists, therefore, may asela
for their primacy elsewhere, but not in the word of God, which

XVI. let us now proceed to show, that our adversaries
baveno more reason for boasting of the authority of the an·
cient Church than of the testimony of the word of God. For
when they bring forward this principle, that the unity of the
Ohurch cannot be preserved, unless it have one supreme head
upon earth, to whom all the members should be subject, and
thal, therefore, the Lord gave the primacy to Peter, and after-
wards by right of succession, to the saeos Rome, that it might
<romain there to the end of time, - they also assert that this has
been the usage from the beginning. Now, as they grossly
pervert various testimonias, I would first make this prelimiuary
remark. I do not deny that the ancient writers uniformly
give great honour to the Roman Church, and speak of it in
respectful terma. 'Phisl consider aa arising priucipally from
three causes. In the first place, that opinion which,I know
not how, had been received, that it had been founded and set·
tled by the ministry of Peter, operated very powerfully to gain
it credit and authority, and, therefore, among the Western
churches it was called the Apostolic See. In the second place,
because it was the capital os the empire; and on this account
it is probable that it contained men superior in learning and
prudence, skill and experience, to those of any other place;
due regard was pald to this circumstance, that the glory of the
city and other far more excellent gifts of God might not appear
to be undervalued. ln the third place, while the Eastern and
Greek Ohurches, and even those in Africa, were agitated by
numerous dissensione of opinion among themselves, the Church
of Rome was more peaceable and less disturbed. Hence it
happened, that picus and holy bishops, on being expelled from
their sees, frequently resorted thither, as to an asylum or port
of safety. For as the people of Europe have less subtlety and
activity of mind than the inhabitants of Asia and Africa, so
they are not so volatile or desirous of novelty. lt -considerably
increased the authority of the Ohurch of Rome, therefore, that
in those uncertain times it was not sc much agitated as the
other Churches, and was more tenacious of the doctrine
which it had once received than all the rest, as we shall pre·
eently show more at large. On account of these three cauma,
1 say, it was held in more than common respect, and received
many honourable testimonies from ancient writers.
