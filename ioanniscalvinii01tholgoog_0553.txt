The advocates of transubstantiation contend that the pronoun
this denotes the appearance of the bread, because the conse-
cration is made hythe whole of the sentence, and there is no
visible substance, according to them, which can be indicated
by it. But if they are guided by a scrupulous attention to the
words, because Christ declared that which he gave into the
hands of his disciples to be uis body, nothing can be more at
varianae with a just interpretationes thern, than the notion that
what before was bread had now become the body of Christ.
For it was that which Christ took into his hands to deliver to his
disciples, that he asserts to be his body, but he toolr ‘⁴ breod.'’
Who does not perceive, then, that that , to which this pronoun
referred was bread still? and therefore nothing would be more
absurd than to transfer to a mere appearance or visionary form
, that which was spoken of real hread. Others, when they ex-
plain the word is to denote transubstantiation, have recourse to
an interpretation still more violently perverted and unnatural.
They have not the least colour, therefore, for a pretence that
they are influenced by a scrupulous reverence for the words of
Christ. For to use the word is to siguify a transmutation into
another substance, is a thing never heard of, in any country or
in any language. Those who acknowledge the continuance of
bread in the supper, and affirm that it is accompanied with
the real body of Christ, differ considerably among themselves.
'I'hose of thern who express themselves more modestly, though
they strenuously insist on the literal meaning of these words,
, “This t's my body,'’ yet afterwards depart from their literal
precision, and explain them to import that the body of Christ
is with the bread, in the bread, aud under the bread. Of the

arguing respecting the words, by which they consider them-
selves bound, so that they cannot admit the bread to be called
his body, because it is a sign of it. But if they object to every
trope, and insist on taking the words in a sense strictly literal,
why do they forsake the language of Christ, and adopt a phra-
seology of their own so very dissimilar? For there is a wide
dill'erence between these two assertions, that “the bread is the
body,’' and that “the body is with the bread.'’ But because
they perceived the impossibility of supporting this simple propo-
sition, “that the bread is the body,'' they have endeavoured
to escape from their embarrassment by those evasione Others,
more daring, hesitate uot to assert, that, in strict propriety of
