its nature, comprehends generally all the signs which God has
ever given to men, to certify and assure themoi the truth os
his promises. These he hasbeen pleased to place in natural
things, and sometimes to exhibit in miracles. Examples of the
former kind are such as these: when he gave Adam and Eve
the tree of life, as a pledge os immortality, which they might
assure themselves os enjoying as long as they should eat os the
fruit oi that tree;(w) and when he “ set '’ his “bow in the
cloud,'' as a token to Noah and his posterity, that there should
“ no more be a flood to destroy the earth.’' (c) These Adam
and Noah had as sacraments. Not that the tree would ac-
tually communicate immortality to them, which it could not
give to itscls3 or that the rainbow, which is merely a refrac-
tion of the rays oi the sun on the opposite clouds, would have
any efficacy in restraining the waters; but because they had
a mark impressed upon them by the word of God, eonstitu-
ting them signs and seals of his covenants. 'Phe tree and the
rainbow both existed before, but when they were inscribed with
the word of God, they were endued with a new form, so that
they began to be something that they were not before. And
that no one may suppose this to be spoken in vain, the bow
iteels continues to be a witness to usin the present age, of that
covenant which God made with Noah: whenever we behold
it, we read thie promise of God in it, that he would never more
destroy the earth with a flood. Thereiore, if any smutterer in
philosophy, witha view to ridicule the simplicity of our saith,
contend that such avariety os colours is the natural result os
the refraction of the solar rays on an opposite cloud, we must ·
immediately acknowledge it, but we may smile at his stupidity
in not acknowledging God as the Lord and Govemor of nature,
who uses all the elements according to his will for the pro·
motion os bis own glory. And is he had impressed similar
characters on the sun, on the stars, on the earth, and on stenes,
they would all have been sacramente to us. Whyis not silver
of as much velue before it is coined, as it is aster, since the
metal is the very same? 'Phe reason is, that it has nothing
added to its natural state ; stamped with a public impression,
it becomes money, and receives a new valuation. And shall .
not God be able to mark his creatures with his word, that they
may become sacraments, though beiore they were mere ele·
ments? Examples oi the second kind were exhibited, when
God shewed Abraham “a smoking furnace and a buming
lamp;'' (y) when he watered the fleece with dew while the
earth remained dry, and afterwards bedewed the earth without
wetting the fleece, to promise victory to Gideon ς (z) when “ be
