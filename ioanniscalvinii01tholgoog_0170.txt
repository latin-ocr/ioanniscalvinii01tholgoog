done any good or evil; iu order to prove the foundation of Divine

predestination not to be in works. (t) Secondly, when he misas
the objection whether God is unjust, he never urges, what would
have been the most absolute and obvious defence of his justice,
that God rewarded Esau according to his wickedness; but con·
tants himself with a different solution, that the reprobate are
raised up for this purpose, that the glory of God may be dis·
played by their means. Lastly, he subjoins a concluding obser·
watien, that “ God hath mercy on whom he will have mercy, and
whom he will he hardeneth.’'(u) You see how he attributes
both to the mere will of God. If, therefore, we can assign no
reason why he grente mercy to his pcople but because such is
his pleasure, neither shall we find any other cause but his will
for the reprobation of others. F'or when Gadis said to hardan
or show mercy to whom hc pleases, rnen are taught by this
declaration to seelr no cause beside his will.

agitation aa if alarmed by the sound of a martial trumpet.
Many, indeed, as if they wished to avert odium from God,
admit election in such a way as to deny that anyone is repro·
bated. But this is puerile and absurd, because election itself .
could not exist without being opposed to reprobation Gadis
said to separate those whom he adopts to salvation. '1¹0 say
that others obtain by chance, or acquire by their own efforts,
that which election alone confers on a few, will be worse than
absurd. Whom God pasees by, therefore, he reprobates, and
from no other cause than his determination to exclude them
from the inheritance which he predestines for his children.
And the petulance of men is intolerable, if it refuses to be rc·
strained by the word of God, which treats of his incomprehen-
sible counsel, adored by angela themselves. But now wc have
heard that hardening proceeds from the Divina power and will,
as much es mercy. Unlilre the persons l have mentioned,
Paul never strives to excuse God by false allegations3 he only
