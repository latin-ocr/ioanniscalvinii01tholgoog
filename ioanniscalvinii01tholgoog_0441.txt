that we are not instituting an unnecessary discussion, when
we treat ot' vows.

11. li we would avoid any error in judging what vowe are legit·
imate, and what are preposterous, it is necessary to consider three
things-first, to whom vows are to be addressad; secondly,
who we are that make vows; lastly, with what intention vows
are made. The first consideration calls us to reflect, that we
have to do with God; who takes such pleasure in our obedi·
cuce, that he pronounoes a curse on all acts of will-worship,
however specious and splendid they may be inthe eyes of men
lt God abominatas all voluntary services invented by us with·
out his command, it follows, that nothing can be acceptable to
him, except what is approved by his word. let us not, there·
sore, assume to ourselves such a great liberty, as to presumo to
vow to God any thing that has no testimony of his approbation.
For the maxim of Paul, that ‘⁴ whatsoever is notos saith is
sin,’'(a) while it extends to every action, is without doubt
principally applicable when a man addresses his thoughts di·
rectlyto God. Paul is there arguing respectiug the differenos
of meats3 andis we errand sall even in things of the least
moment, where we are not enlightened bytho certainty of
saith, how much greater modesty is requisito when waere en·
dertalring a business of the greatest importancel For nothing
ought to be of greater importance to us than the dutiae of
religion. Let this, then, be our first rule in regard to vove-
never to attempt vowing any thing without a previous convie-
tion of conscience, that we are attempting nothing rsshly.
And our conscience will be secure from all danger of restruere,
when it shall have God for its guide, dictating, as it were, by
his word, what it is proper or useless to do.

lIl. The second consideration which we have mentioned,
cellsus to measure our strength, to contemplate our calling,
and not to neglect the liberty which God hes conferred on us.
For he who vows what is not in his power, oris repugnant to
his calling, is chargeable with rashness3 and he who despises
tha favour os God, by which he is constituted lord of all things,
is guilty os ingratitude. By this remark, 1 do not intend that
we have any thing in our power, so as to enable us to promise
it to God in areliance on our own strength. For, with the
strictest regard to truth, it was decreed in the council of
Arausium, that nothing is rightly vowed to God but what we
have received from his hand, seeing that all the things which are
presented to him are merely gifts which he has imparted. But
as some things are given to us by the goodness of God, and
other things are denied to us by his justice, let every meu
