os the Spirit is the bond which unites us to Christ. Nor is
there any more truth in their other objection, that we attend
to nothing but the fruitur effect which believers experience
from feeding on the fiesh os Christ. For we have already
said, that Christ himself is the matter or substance os the

sacred supper, and that it isin consequence os this, that vre
are absolved, srom our sins hythe sacrifice of his death, are
washed in his blood, and by his resurrection are raised to the
hope of the heavenly lise. But the soolish imagination, of
which Lombard was the author, has perverted their minda,
while they have supposed the sacrament to consist in eating
the flesh of Christ. For these are his words: “The sacra-
ment, without the thing, consists in the forms of breed and
wine; the sacrament and the thing are the flesh and blood of
Christ; the thing, without the sacrament, is his mystical
flesh.'' Again, a little aster: “ 'I'he thing signified and con-
tained is the proper flesh of Christ, the thing signified and
not contained, is his mystical body.'’ With his distinction
between the ssesh os Christ, and the power which it has to
nourish, I sully agree3 but his notion, os what is a sacrament,
and as contained under the bread, is an error not to be endured
Hence proceeded a salse idea of sacramental eating, because
they supposed the body os Christ to be caten by impious and
profane persons, notwithstanding they were strangers to him.
But the llesh of Christ itsell, in the mystery os the supper, is
as much a spiritual thing, as our eternal salvation. Whence
we conclude, that persons who are destitute os the Spirit of
Christ, can no more eat the flesh of Christ, than drinlr wine
which has no teste. lt is certainly offering an insult, and
doing violence to Christ, to attribute tohim a body all seeble
and dead, which is promiscuously distributed to unbelievers;
auditis expressly contradicted by his own words: “He that
eateth my flesh, and drinlreth my blood, dwelleth in me, and 1
in him.'' (a) They reply‚ that the discourse from which this
text is quoted does not treat of sacramental eating; and this 1
concede to them, only let them not be perpetually striking on
the same rock, that the flesh ol Christ may hecaten without
any benefit. But 1 would wish them to inform me how long
they retain it after they have eaten it. Here [believe they
will find it impossible to escape. But they object, that the
truth os the promises of God can sustain no diminution or fail-
ure from the ingratitude os men. Thisl admit; and 1 also
maintain, that the virtue of this mystery remains unimpaired,
notwithstanding wiclred men exert their utmost efforts to de·
stroy it. Itis one thing, however, sor the body of Christ to
