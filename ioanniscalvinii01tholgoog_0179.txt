of condemnation, which is naarer to us in the corrupt nature
of mankind, than search after a hidden and altogether incom-
prehensible one in the predestination of God. aad we should
feel uo reluctanca to submit onr understanding' to the infinite
wisdom of God, so far as to acquiesce in its many mysteries.
To ba ignorant of things which it is neither possible nor law·
sul to know, is to be learned: an eageruess to know them, is
a species of madness.

IX. Some oue perhaps will say, that lhava not yet adduced
asufficient answer to that sacrilegious excuse. Iconfess it is
impossible ever wholly to prevent the petulance and murmura
of impiety; yet 1 think 1 have said what should suffice to re-
mova not only all just ground, but every plausible pretext, sor
objection. The reprobate wish to ba thought excusable in
sinning, because they cannot avoid a necessity ol sinning; ,
especially since this necessity is laid upon them by the ordina·
tion os God. But we deny this to ba a just excuse; because
the ordination of God, by which they complain that they are
destined to destnrction, is guided by equity, unknown indeed
to us, but indubitably certain. Whence we conclude, that they
sustsin no misery that is not inflicted upon them, by the most
righteous judgment of God. ln the next place, we maintain

, that they act preposterously, who, in secking sor the origin of

their condemnation, direct their views to the secret racessas
os the Divina connsel, and overlook tha cornrption os natura,
which is its real source. Tha testimony God gives to his cre·
ation preventa their imputing it to him. For though, by the
etamal providence os God, man was created to that misery to
which he is subject, yet the ground of it he has derived from
himself, not from God 3 since he is thus ruined solely in con·
sequence of his having degenerated from the pure creation of
God to vicious and impura depravity.

X. rI'he doctrine os God’s predestinationis calumniated by
its adversaries, as involvinga third absurdity. For when we
attribute it solely to the determination of the Divina will, that
those whom God admits to ba hairs of his kingdom are exempt-
ed from the universal destruction, from this they inser, that he
is a respectar os persons, which tha Scriptura uniformly denies3
that, therefore, either the Scriptura is inconsistent with itsels,
or in tha election os God regard ishad to merits. ln the first
place, tha Scriptura denies that God is a respectet os persons,
in a different sense from that in which they understand it; for
by tha word pwson, it signifies not a man, but those things in
a man, which, being conspicuous to tha eyes, usually con·
ciliate favour, honour, and diguity, or attract hatred, contempt,
and disgraca. Sachare riches, waalth‚ power, nobility, magis·
