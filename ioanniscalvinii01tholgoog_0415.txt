have brought it to the brinlr of ruin. In the time of Gregory

the First, when the guardians of the ecclesiastical property ἱ

seined for themselves the lands which belonged to thc Chureh,
and, according to the custom os princes, set up their titles and
armorial bearings on them in tohen os their claim, Gregory
assembled a provincial council of bishops, in which he severely
inveighed against that profane custom, and ashed whether they
would not excommunicate any ecclesiastic who should attempt
the seizure of property by the inscription os a title, or even any
bishop who should direct such a thing to be done, or if done
without his direction, should not punish it. They all pronoun-
ced that every such offender should be excommunicated. But
is claiming a field by the inscription os a title, be a crime de-
serving of excommunication in a priest,— when sor two whole
centuries the pontiffs have been meditating nothing but wars, es·
fusion os blood, slaughter of armies, storming and pillaging cities,

the glory of God, to sound doctrine, or to the sasety of the
Ohurch3 but they are infatuated, and stimulated by the mere
lust os dominion; and consider nothing as safe, unless, as the
prophet says, “they rule with force and with cruelty.’' (b)

the Roman ecclesiastics errogate to themselves. For they
consider it a degradation for them to appear before a civil
judge in personal causes, and they imagine the liberty and
dignity os the Chnrch to consist in their exemption from the
common judicature and laws. But the ancient bishops, who in
other respects were the most rigid assertors of the rights of the
Ghurch, esteemed it no injury to themselves, orto their order,
to be subject to lay judges in civil causes. The pious empe-
rors also, without any opposition, always summoned the clergy
before their tribunals, whenever necessity required it. For
this is the language of Constantine, in his epistle to the bishops
os Nicomedia: “ ls any bishop excite any disturbance by his,
indiscretion, his presumption shall be restrained hythe author·
ity of the minister os God, that is, by mine.” And Valentinian
says, “ Good bishops never traduce the power of the emperor,
but sincerely observe the commands of God, the sovereign King,
and obey our laws.'’ At that time this principle was universally
admitted, without any controversy. Ecclesiastical causes were
