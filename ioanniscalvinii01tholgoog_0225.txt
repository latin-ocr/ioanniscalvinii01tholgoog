Xll. Now, as no description can equal the severity of the
Divine vengeance on the reprobate, their anguish and tormcnt
are figuratively represented to us under corporeal images; as,
darkness, weeping, and gnashing of teeth, unextinguishable lire,
a worm incessantly gnawing the beart. (p) For there can be
no doubt but that, by such modes ot‘ expression, the Holy Spirit
intended to consound all our saculties with horror3 as when it
issaid, that “ 'l'ophet is ordained of old3 the pile thereos is fire
and much wood: the breeth ot‘ the Lord, like astream of
brimstone, doth kindle it.” (q) As these representatione
should assist usin forming some conception of the wretched
condition os the wicked, so they ought principally to fix our
attention on tlre calamity οῖ’ being alieneted from the presence
of God ; and in addition to this, experiencing such hostility
from the Divine majesty es to be unable to escape from
its continual pursuit. For, in the first place, his indignation
is like a most violent fleme, which ‹levours and consumes all
that it touches. ln the next place, all the creetures so subserve
the execution ol his judgment, that those to whom the Lord
will thus manifest his wrath, will find the heaven, the earth,
and the sea, the animels, and all that exists, inflamed, es it were,
with dire indignation against thern, end all armed sor their
destruction. lt is no trivial threatening, therefore, denounced
by the epostle, that unbelievers “ shnll be punished with ever·
’ lasting destruction from the presence of the Lord, and t‘rom the
glory os his power.” (r) And when the prophets excite terror
by corporeal figures, though they advance nothing hyperbolical
for our dull understandings‚ yet they mingle preludes of the
future judgment with the sun, the moon, and the whole fabric
of the world. Wherelore miserable consciences find no reposo,
but ars harassed end agitated witha dreadful tempest, feel
themselves torn asunder by an angry God, and, hanstixed and
penetrated by mortal stings, ere terrified at the thunderbolts of
God, and broken by the weight oi his hand3 so that to sink
into any gulis and abysses would be more tolerable than to
stand lor a moment in these terrore. How great end severe,
then, is the punishment, to endure the never ceasing effecte of
his wrath! On which subject there is a memorabis passage
in the ninetieth psalm3 that though by his countenance he
scatters all mortale, end turns them to destmction, yet he en·
courages his servants in proportion to their timidity in this world,
to excite thern, though under the burden os the cross, to press
sorward, till he shall be all in all.
