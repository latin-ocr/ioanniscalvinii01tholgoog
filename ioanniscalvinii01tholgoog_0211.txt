evidently shewed them to be angele, and not men. After this,
if there was any doubt still remaining, it was removed by
Christ himself. More than once, hie disciples saw, and even
felt and handled him; and their unbelies has eminently con·
tributed to the confirmation of cnr saith. He discoursed among
them conceming the mysteries os the kingdom os God, and at
length they saw him ascend to heaven. (ι) Νοι was this spec·
tacle exhibited only to the elcveu apostles, but “he was seen
οι above five hundred brethren at once.” (m) By the mission
ot* the Holy Spirit he gave an undeniable proos, not only os
his life, but also οι his sovereign dominion3 according to his
prediction, “lt is expedient for you that l go away; sor is l go

dead man, but felt that the person whom he was opposing was

IV. 'I'he remark we have made, that in proving the resurrec-
tion, our mirrds should be directed to the infinite power os God,
is briefly suggested in these words oi Paul: “Who shall
change our vile body, that it may be sashioued like unto his
glorious body, according to the working whereby he is able
even to subdue all things unto himsels.” (p) It would there·
fore be extremely unreasonable here, to consider what could
possibly happen ιιι the ordinary course os nature, when the
object proposed to us is an inestimable miracle, the magnitude
of which absorbs all our saculties Yet Paul adduces an ex·
ample from nature to reprove the solly os those who deny the
resurrection. “Thou sool,’' says he,‘ that which thou son est
is not quickened, except it dic.”(q) lle tells us that seed
sown displays an image os the resurrection, because the corn is
reproduced from putrefaction. Nor would it bea thing so diffi-
cult to believe, il we paid proper attention to the miracles
which present themselves to our view ιιι all parts of the world.
But let us remember, that no man will be truly persuaded os
the future resurrection, but he who rs filled with admiration,
and ascribes to the power of God the glory that rs due to
it. Transported with this confidence, Isaiah exclairns,‘ ‘Thy
dead men shall live; together with my dead body shall they
arise; awake aud sing, ye that dwell ur dustlr 'r() ySurrounded
