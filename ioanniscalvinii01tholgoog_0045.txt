he displays his mercy in his deliverance. Now, we see that
this acceptanee is irrespective of the righteousness of man, but
is an unequivoeal proof of the Divine goodness towards mise·
rable sinners, who are infinitely unworthy os so great a favour.

V. After the Lord has recovered a man from the abyss of
perdition, and separated him to himself by the grace of adop-
tion, -because he has regenerated him, arrd raised him toa new
life, he now receives and embraces him, as a new creature, with
the gists of his Spirit. This is the acceptante mentioned by
Peter, in which even the works of believers after their voea-
tion are approved by God; for the Lord cannot but love and
accept those good effecto which are produced in them by his
Spirit. But it must always be remembered, that they are
accepted by God in consequence of their works, only because,
for their salies and the favour which he bears to them, he
deigns to accept whatever goodness he has liberally communi·
cated to their worhs. For whence proceeds the goodness of
their works, but from the Lord’s determination to adom with
true purity those whom he has chosen as vessels of honour?
And how is it that they are accounted good, as though they
were free from all imperfectiori, except from the mercy of their
Father, who pardons the blemishes which adhere to them? ln
avoid, Peter intends nothing else in this passage, but that God
accepts and loves his children, in whom he bcholds the marlrs
and lineamenta of his own countenance3 for we have elsewhere
shown that regeneration is a reparation of the Divino image in
us. Wherever the Lord contemplatos his own likcness, he
iustly both loves and honours it. 'l'hc life of his children,
therefore, being devoted to holiness and righteousness, is truly
represented as pleasing to him. But as the faithful, while they
are surrounded with mortal flesh, arc still sinnam, and all their
works are imperfect, and tainted with the vices of the fleeh, he
cannot be propitious either to their persons or to their worhs,
without regarding them in Christ rather than in themselves.
lt is in this sense that those passages must be understood,
which declaro God to be merciful and compassionate to the
followers of righteousness. Moses said to the israelites, “The
Lord thy God, which keepeth coronant and mercy with them
that love him and keep his commaudments, to a thousand
generations ’³ (m)-a sentence which was afterwards in frequent
