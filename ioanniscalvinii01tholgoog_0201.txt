of God,’¹ (l) with no other design than to show, that the Jews
are reprobate and strangers ιο the Church, because they are
destitute of docility3 and he adduces no other reason for it
than that the promise of God does not belong to them; which
is confirmed by that passage of Paul, where “ Christ cmcified,
nuto the Jews a stumblingblock, and unto the Greeks foolish-
ness,’' is said ιο be “unto them which are called, the power
of God, and the wisdom of God.” (m) For, after remarking
what generally happens whenever the gospel is preached, that
it exasperatos some, and is despised by others, he represents it
as dnly appreciated only by “ those who are called.” A little
before he had mentioned “them that believe;” not that he
had an intention ιο deny its proper place to the grace of God,
which precedes saith, but he seems ιο add this second descrip
tion by way of correction, in order that those who had received
the gospel might ascribe the praise of their saith ιο the Divina
call. And so, lilrewise, in a subsequent sentence, he represents

· them as the objecta of Divino election. When the impleus

hear these things, they loudly complain that God, by a wauton
exercise of power, abusos his wretched creatures for the sport
of his cruelty. But we, who lrnow that all men are liable to
so many charges at the Divine tribunal, that of a thousand
questions they would be unable to give a satisfactory answer
ιο one, confess that the reprobate suffer nothing but what is
consistent with the most righteous judgment of God 'l'hough
we cannot comprehend the reason of this, let us he content
with some degree of ignorante where the wiadom of God soars
into its own sublimity.

XV. But aa objections are frequently raised from some pes·
nages of Scriptura, in which God seems to deny that the de·
struction of the wished is caused by his deerea, but that, in
opposition ιο his remonstrances, they voluntarily bring ruin
npon themselves, -let us show by abrief explication that they
are not at all inconsistent with the foregoing doctrine. A pas·
saga is produced from Ezelriel, where God says, “l have no
pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn
from his way and live.” (rr) If this is to be extended to all
mankind, why does ha not urge many to repentauce, whose
minda are more flexible ιο obedience than those of others, who
grow more and more callous to his daily invitatione? Among
the inhabitants of Nineveh and Sodom, Christ himself declares
that his evangelicul preachiug and miracles would have brought
forth more fruit thau in Judea. How is it, then, if God will
have all men to be saved, that he opens not the gate of repent·
auce ιο those miserable men who would be more ready to re·
