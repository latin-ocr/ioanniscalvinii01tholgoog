such supplications,) what will he do, who is ‘⁴ the Father of
mercies, and the God of all comfort? ” (a) Will henot hear
the eries and groans of his children when they deprecate his
displeasure for themselves, especially since it is to this that he
invites and exhorts us3 rather than attend to any intercessions
of others, to which they resort in great consternation, not with-
out some degree of despair, arising from a doubt of the kind·
ness and clemency of their Father? Of this exuberance of
paternal kindness, he gives us abeautisul representation in a
parable ; (y) where a father meets and embraces a son who had
alienated himself from his family, who had dissolutely lavished
his substance, who had grievously offended himin every re·
spect: nor does he wait till he actually supplicares for pardou,
but anticipares him, recognizes him when returning at a great
distance, voluntarily runs to meet him, consoles him, and re·
ceives him into favour. For by proposing to our view an ex·

ing our ingratitudo, rebellion, and wickedness, to expect from
him, who is not only our Father, but the most benevolent and
merciful of all fathers provided we only cast ourselves on his
mercy. And to give us the more certain assurance that he is such
a Father, if we be Christiane, he will be called not only “ Father,”
but expressly “ Our Father ; '’ as though wc might address him
iu the following manner: Ο Father, whose affection towards thy
children is so strong, and whose readiness to perdon thern is so
great, we thy children invoke thee and pray to thee, under the
assurance and full persuasion that thou hast no other than a
paternal affection towards us, how unworthy socver we are of
such a Father. But because the contracted capacitics of our
minds cannot conceive of a favour of such immense magnitude,
we not only have Christ as the pledge and earnest of adoption,

’ but as a witness of this adoption he gives us tha Spirit, by

whom we are enabled with a loud voice frecly to cry, “ Abba,
Father.'' (z) Whenevcr, therefore, we may be embanassed
by auy difficulty, let us remembcr to supplicate him, that he
will correct our timidity‚ and give us this spirit of magnanimity
to enable usto pray with boldncss.

vidual should appropriate him to himself exclusivcly as his
Fathcr, but rather that we should all in common call him Our
Father, we are thereby admonished how strong a fraternal
affection ought to prevail among uS, who, by the same pri-
vilege of mercy aud free grace, are equally the children os such
a Father. Foris wc all have one common Fathcr, (a) from
