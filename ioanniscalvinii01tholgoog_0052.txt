when speaking by the mouth of Paul. The Spirit asserta, by
the mouth of Paul, that Abraham obtained righteousness by
saith, not by works; we likewisc teach, that we are all justified
by saith without the works of the law. The same Spirit
affirma by James, that both Abraham's righteousness and ours
consists in works, and not in saith only. That the Spirit is not
inconsistent with himself isa certain truth. But what harmony
can there be between these two apparently opposite assertionsl
Our adversaries would be satisfied, if they could totally subvert
the righteousness os saith, which we wish to be firmly es·
tablished; but to afford tranquillity to the disturbed conscience,
they feel very little concern. Hence we perceive‚ that they
oppose the doctrine of justification by saith, but at the same
time fix no certain rule of righteousness, by which the con-
science may be satisfied Let them triumph then asthey please,
is they can boast no other victory but that os having removed
all certainty of righteousness. And this miserable victory,
indeed, they will obtain, where, aster having extinguished the
light of truth, they are permitted by the lord to spread the
shades os error. But, wherever the truth of God remains, they
will not prevail. Ι deny, therefore, that the assertiones dames,
which they hold up against us as an impenetrable shield, affords
them the least support. To evinco this, we shall first examine
the scope of the apostle, and then remark wherein they are de-
ceived. &cause there were many persons at that time, and the
Church is perpetually insested with similar charactera who, by
neglecting and omitting the proper duties of believers, manifest-
ly betrayed their real infidelity, while they continued to glory in
the false pretence of saith, James here exposes the soolish con·
fid'ence os such persons. lt is not his design, then, to diminish,
in any respect, the virtue of true felth, but to show tlre solly of
these triflers, who were content with arrogating to themselves
the vain image of it, and securely abandoned themselves to
every vice. This statement being premised, it will be easy
to discover where lies the errores our adversaries. For they
fall into two fallacies3 one respecting the word “saith'' the

⁸ other respecting the word “justification.” When the apostle

gives· the appellation offcitlr to a vain notion, widely different
from true saith, it is a concession which derogates nothing from
the argument ; this he shows from the beginning in these words:
“What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he bath
saith, and have not works? ” (n) He does not say, Is any one
have saith without worlrs; but, If any one boast of having it.
He speaks still more plainly just aster, where he ridicules it by
representing itas worse than the knowledge os devils; and lastly,

(η) Jeme· n. u.
