Christ in the sacred supper, as neither, on the one hand, to
fasten him to the clementes bread, or to enclose himin it, or
in any way to circumscribe him, which would derogata from
his celestial glory; nor, on the other hand, to deprive him of his
corporeal dimensions, or to represent his body as in different
places at once, or to assign it an immensity diffused through
heaven and earth, which would be clearly inconsistent with the
reality of his human nature. Let us never suffer ourselves to
be driven from these two exceptions; that nothing be main-
tained derogatory to Christ's celestial glory; which is the case
when he is represented as brought under the corruptible elc-
ments of this world, or sastened to any carthly objects; and
that nothing be attributed to his body incompatible with the
human nature; which is the case when it is represented as
infinite, or is said to be in more places than one at the same
time. These absurdities being disclaimed, lrcadily admit
whatever may serve to express the true and'substantial com-
munication os the body and blood of the Lord, which is given
to believers under the sacred symbols os the supper3 and to
express it in a manner implyiug not a mere reception of it in
the imagination or apprehension of their mind, but a real enjoy-
ment os it as the food of eternal lise. Nor can any cause be
assigned, why this opinion is so odious to the world, and the
minda of multitudes are so unjustly prejudiced against any
defence of it, but that they have been awsully infatuated with
the delusions 31 Satan. It is certain that the doctrine we ad·
33333 is in all respects in perfect harmony with the Scriptures3
it contains nothing absurd, ambiguous, or obscure ; it is not
at all inimical to true piety, or solid edification; in short, it
includes nothing that can offend, except that for several ages,
while the ignorance and barbarismos the sophists prevailed
over the Chnrch, this very clear light and obvious truth was
shamefully suppressed. Yet, as, in the present age also, Satan
is making the most powersul exertions to oppose it, and is cm-
ploying turbulent spirits to endeavour to blacken it by every
possible calumny and reproach, it is necessary to be the more
diligent in asserting 3ηά desending it.

XX. Now, before we procecd any further, it is requisita to dis·
cuss the institution itsels ; because the most plausible objection
of our adversaries is, that we depart from the words of Christ.
To exonerate ourselves from the false charge which they bring
against us, it is highly proper, therefore, to begin withan expo·
sitiones 133 words. The account given by three of the evan-
gelists, and by Paul, informs us, that “ Jesus took bread, and gave
thanlrs, and blessed it, and bralre it, and gave it to the disciples,
aud said, Take, eat; this is my body, which is given or broken

sor you. And he toolr the cup, and said, This cup is my blood
