true nature of the most sanctimonious sanctity of the mass, on
account of which it has attracted so much admiration and
veneration for so many ages. For an illustration of such great
mysteries proportioned to their dignity‚ would require a larger
treatise; and Iam unwilling to introduce those disgusting cor·
ruptions which are nniversally notorious 3 that all men may un·
derstand that the mass, considered in its choicest and most esti·
mable purity, without any of its appendages‚ from the beginning
to the end, is full of every species of impiety, blasphemy,
idolatry, and sacrilege.

XIX. The readers may now see, collected into a brief
summary, almost every thing that 1 have thought important to
be known respecting these two sacrarnents3 the use of which
hasbeen enjoined on the Christian Church from the corn·
mencernent of the New Testament until the end of time, that
isto say, baptism, to be a kind of entrance into the Church,
andan initiatory profession of faith; and the Lord’s supper,
to bea continual nourishment, with which Christ spiritually
feeds his family of believers Wherefore, as there is but “one
God, one Christ, one faith,” one Church, the body of Christ,
so there is only “ one baptism'' and that is never repeated ;
but the supper is frequently distributed, that those who have
once becn admitted into the Church, may understand that
they are continually nourished by Christ. Beside these two,
as no other sacrament hasbeen instituted by God, so no other
ought to be acknowledged by the Church of believers. For
that it is not left to the will of man to institute new sacra·
ments, will be easily understood if we remember what has
already been very plainly stated-that sacraments are ap-
pointed by God for the purpose of instructing usrespecting
some promise of his, and assuring us of his good-will towards
us; and if we also consider, that no one hasbeen the coun-
sellor of God, capable of affording ns any certainty respecting
his will, (c) or fumishing us any assurance of his disposition
towards us, what he chooses to give or to deny us. Hence it
follows, that no one can institute a sign to be a testimony re-
specting any determination or promise of his ; he alone can fur·
nish us a testimony respecting himself by giving a sign. I will
express mysels in terms more concise, and perhaps more horne·
ly, but more explicit—that there can be no sacrament unac-
companied with a promise of salvation. All mankind, collected
in one assembly, can promise us nothing respecting our sal·
vation. Therefore they can never institute or establish a
sacrament.

XX. Lct the Christian Church, therefore, be content with
