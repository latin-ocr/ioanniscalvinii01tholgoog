Conneil of Carthago: “ Let no presbyter be permitted to re·
concile a peniteat publiely at the mass.” And another decree ol
the Council of Arausium: “ Let those who, during the period
of their penitence, departent of this lise, be admitted to the
communion without the reconciliatory impositiones hands
Is they recover srom their illness, let them complete the period
os their penitence, and then let them receive from the bishop
the reconciliatory imposition of hands.'' Also the decree
os the third Conncil os Carthago: “ [et not a presbyter recon-
cile a penitent without the authority of the bishop.” nne
designes all these decrees was, to prevent the severity which
they wished to preserve in this matter srom falling into dis·
use. Therefore they committed it to the cognizance of the
bishop, who was likely to be more circumspect in conducting
the examination. But cyprian states that it was not the
bishop alone who laid hands on the peniteat, but that all the
clergy also united in this act. These are his wordst ⁴‘ ‘l'hey
do penance sor a proper time, and then they come to tha
communion, and are restored to the right os communion by
the imposition os the hands os the bishop and clergy.” Aster-
wards, in procoss os time, the cnstom was corrupted, so that
they used this ceremony in private absolutioris, without any
public expression os penitence. Hence that distinction in
Gratian, between public and private reconciliation. I consider
that ancient custom, which is mentioned by Cypriae, to have
been hely and usesul te the Church, and could wish it wera
revived in the present day. This more recent one, though 1
venture not to condemn or censure it with severity, yet l consider
less necessary. We see, however, that impositiones hands on
repentanee is a ceremony albumen, not ol [livine institution,
and is to be placed among indifferent things and external exer·
cises, such as are not to be despised, but ought to hold a station
iar helosw the sacramenta, which are enjoined upon ua by the
wor o God.

XV. Now, the Romish theologians and scheolmen, vrho are
in the habit os corrupting every thing by misinterpretation,
take very great paine here to discover a sacrament, hut to no
purpose. Nor ought this to be wondered at, sor they seek it
where it is not to be senud. When they have done their best,
they leave the subject perplexed, doubtful, uncertain, and con·
founded with a variety os opinions. They say, then, that
external penitence is a sacrament, and is it be so, that it ought
to be consideratius a sign of internal penitence, that is, of
contrition of heart, which is the substance os the sacrament3
or that both together constitute the sacrament, not two sacra·
ments, but one complete one; but that external penitence ia
merely the sacrament 3 while that which is internal is both the
