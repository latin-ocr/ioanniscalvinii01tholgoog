the word evil, whether we understand the devil or sin, is ot' little

our destruction. Our petition therefore is, that we may not
be overwhelmed and conquered by any temptatione, but that
we may stand, strong in the power of the Lord, against
all adverse powers that assault us, which is not to submit
to temptations; that being taken into his custody and charge,
and being secure in his protection‚ we may persevera uncon⁶
qnered, and risc superior to sin, death, the gates of hell, and
the whole kingdom of the davil. 'l'his is being delivered
from evil. Here it must also be carcfully remarked, that it is
not in our power to contend with so powersul an enemy as the
devil‚ and sustain the violence of his assaults. Otherwise it χ
would be useless, or insulting, to supplicate from God what wc
already possessed in ourselves. Certainly, they who prepare
themselves for such a combat with sels-confidence, are not
sufficiently aware of the skill and prowess of the enemy that
they have to meet. Now, we pray to be delivered from his
power, as from the mouth of a ravenous and raging lion, just
about to tear us with his teeth and claws, and to swallow us
down his throat, unless the Lord snatch us from the jaws of
death3 knowing, at the same time, that if the Lord shall be
present and light for us while we are silent, in his strength
“ we shall do valiantly.'’ (z) Let others confide as they please
in the native abilities and powers of free-will, which they
suppose themselves to possess-let it be sufficient for us, to
stand and be strong in the power of God alone. But this
petition comprehends more than at first appears. For if tbo
Spirit of God is our strength for fighting the battle with Satan,
we shall not be able to gain the victory, till, being full of him,
we shall have laid asido all the infirmity of our flesh. When
we pray for deliverance from Satan and sin, therefore, we pray
to be frequently enriched with new accessions of Divine grace3
till, being quite filled with them, we may be able to triumph
over all evil. To some there appears a difficulty and harshness
in our petition to God, that he will not lead us into temptation,
whereas, according to James, it is contrary to his nature for
him to tempt us. (a) But this objection has already been
partly answered, because our own lust is properly the cause of
all the temptatione that overcome us, and therefore we are
charged with the guilt. Nor does James intend any other than to
essert the futility and injustice of transferring to God the vices
which we are constrained to imputa to ourselves, beccam we

are consciens of our being guilty of them But notwithstanding
