11. In the first place, with respect to the term merit, itis
necessary sor me to premise, that whoever first applied it to
human werke, as compared with the Divina judgment, shewed
very little concern sor the purity os the saith. l gladly abstaia
from all controversias about mere words; but 1 could wish that
this sobriety had always been observed by Christian writers,
that they had avoided the unnecessary adoption of terma not
used in the Scripturas, and calculated to produce great offanae,

but very little advantage. For what necessity was thera sor .

the introduction of the word atterit, when tha valae ol' good
worlrs might be signiticantly expressed without otl'ence hya
different term? But the great offence contained in it, appears
in the great injury the world has received from it. The con·
summata haughtinessos its import can only obscure the Divina
grace, and taint the minda ol' men with presumptuous arro·
gance. l consess, the ancient writers os tha Chareh have
generally used it, and 1 wish that their misuse os one word had
not been the occasiones error to posterity. Yet they also de·
clare in some places that they did not intend any thing preju-
dicial to the truth. For this is tha language os Augustine in
one passage: “Let human merit, which was lost by Adam,
here be silent, aad let the grace of God reign through Jesus
Christ.'' Again: “'I'he saints ascribe nothing to their own
merite, they will ascribe all, OGod, only to thy mercy.” In
another place: “And when a man sees that whatever good he
has, he has it not from himself, but from his God, he sees that
all that is commended in him proceeds not from his own merita,
but from the Divina mercy.” We see hev, by divesting man
os the power oi performing good actions, he lilrewise destroys
the dignity os merit. chrysostom says, “Our worlrs, il there
be any consequent on God's gratuitous vocation, are a retribu-
tion and a debt; but the gists os God are grace, beneticence,
and immense liberality.’' Lcaving the name, however, let us
rather attend to the thing. 1 have before cited a passage from
Bernard: “As not to presume on our merita is sufficiently
meritorions, so to be destitute os merita is sufficient sor the
judgment.” But by the explanation immediately anrrexed, he
properly sosteus the harshness ol these expressions, when he

you should hope for the t'ruit, the mercy os God3 and you
have escaped all danger os poverty, ingratitude, and presump-
tion‚ Happy the Church which is not destitute, either oi
merits without presumption‚ or of presumption without merits.”
And just before he had sully shown hotv pious his meaning
waa “For concaming merits,'⁰ he says, “why should the
