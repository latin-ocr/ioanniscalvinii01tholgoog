be offered, and another for it to be received. Christ presente
this spiritual meat and spiritual drink to all; some receive
them with avidity, others fastidiously reject them; shall their
rejection cause the meat anddrinlr tolose their nature? They
will plead, that their sentiment is supported by this similitude -
that the flesh of Christ, though it be not relished by nnbelievers,
nevertheless still continues to be flesh. But I deny that it can
ever be eaten without the taste of faith; or, if the language os
Augustius be preferred, 1 deny that men carry away from the
sacrament any more than they collect in the vessel of faith.
Thus, nothing is taken from the sacrament, bnt its truth and
efficacy remain unimpaired‚ notwithstanding the wicked de·
part empty from its external participation. lf our adversaries
object again, that it derogates from these words, “This is my
body,’' if the wicked receive corruptible bread, and nothing
more, the answer is easy-That God will have his veracity
discovered, not in the reception itself, but in the constancy
of his goodness, since he is ready to impert to the unworthy,
and even liberally offers to them, that which they reject. And
thiais the perfectiori of the sacrament, which the whole world
cannot violate, that the flesh and blood of Christ are as trnly
given to the unworthy, asto the elect and faithful people of
God3 but it is likewise true, that as rain, falling upon a hard

rock, runs off from it without penetrating into the stone, thus
the wicked, by their obduracy, repel the grace of God, so that
it does not enter into their hearts. Resides, a reception of
Christ, without faith,is as great an absurdity, as for seed to
germinate in the fire. Their inquiry, how Christ carne for

condemnation to some, unless they receive him unworthily, is
agroundless cavil; for we nowhere read that the perditiones
man is owing to an unworthy reception of Christ, but rather
to a rejection of him. Nor can they derive any assistance from
the parable in which Christ speaks os some seed springing up
among thorus, and being afterwards choked and destroyed3 for
he is there showing what value belongs to that temporary faith,
which our adversaries suppose to be unnecessary to a pertici·
pation of the flesh and blood of Christ, placing Judas, in this
respectarem equality with Peter. Their error is rather re-
futed by another part of the same parable, in which Christ
speaks of some seed as having fallen by the way-side, and
some on stony ground, neither of which took any 1·oot.(y)
Whence it follows, that the obduracy of nnbelievers is such an
obstacle, that Christ does not reach them. Whoever desires
our salvation to be promoted by this mystery, will find nothing
more proper than that believers, conducted to the fountain,
