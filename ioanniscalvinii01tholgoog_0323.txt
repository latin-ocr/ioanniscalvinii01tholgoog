helius, who was bishop of Rome. He distinguishes him by
uo other appellation than that of brother, or sellom bishop,
or colleogue. But when he writes to Stephen, the successor
of Cornelius, he not only treats him as equal to himself and
others, but even addresses him with considerable severity,
charging him at one time with arrogance, and at another with
ignorance. Since the time of Cyprian, we know what was
the decision of the whole African Church on this subject. l⁴¹or
the Oouncil of Carthage prohibited that any one should be
called “the princeos priests,’' or “the first bishop‚'' but only
“the bishop of the first see.'' But any one who examines the
more ancient records, will find that at that time the bishop of
Rome was content with the common appellation of brother. lt

altogether unknown: nothing was heard of a supreme pontifi
or a sole head of the Ohurch upon earth. Andif the bishop
of Rome had been presumptuous enough to make any such
assumption, there were judicious meu who would immediately
have repressed his folly. Jerome, being a Roman presbyter,
was not reluctant to assert the dignity of his Ohurch as far as
matter of fact and the state of the times admitted3 yet we see
how he also reduces it to an equality with others. “ lf it be a
question of authority,'' he says, “ the world isgreater than a
city. Why do you allege to me the custom of a single city?
Why do you set upa few instances, which have given rise to
pride, against the laws of the Ohurch? Wherever there is a
bishop, whether at Rome, at Eugubium, at Constantinople‚ or
at Rhegium, he is of the same dignity and of the same priest-
hood. The power of riches, or the abasemsnt of poverty, makes
no bishop superior or inferior to another.”

IV. Respecting the title of nnionsal bishop, the first con·
tention arose iu the tirne of Gregory, and was occasioned by
the ambition of John, bishop of Constantinople. For he want·
ed to make himself universal bishop-an attempt which hed
never been made by any one before. ln that controversy
Gregory does not plead against this as the assumption of a
right which belonged to himself, but resolutely protests against
it altogether, as a profane and sacrilegious application, and even
as the forernnner of Antichrist. He says, “ If he who is called
universal falls, the foundation of the whole Ohurch sinks at
once.” ln another place: “ lt is amost melancholy thing to

hear with any patience, that our brother and companion in the
episcopal office should look down with contempt on all others,
and be called sole bishop. But what does this pride of his
indicate, but that the times of Antichrist ars already at bandi
