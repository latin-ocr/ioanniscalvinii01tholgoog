278 immonsa or aaa [acca iv.

is the cnstom of the apostolic see, at the ordination of a bishop,
to‘command him that all the revenue received by him be
divided into four portions; namely, one for the bishop and his
family,=for the support of hospitality and entertainmeut; the
second for the clergy; the third for the p00r; the fourth for the
reparetiou of Churches.’' lt was unlawful for the bishop,
therefore, to take for his own use any thing more than was
sufficient for moderate and frugal sustenance and clothing. If
any one began to transgress the dne limita, either iu luxury, or
in ostentation aud pomp, he was immediately admonished by
his colleagues; and if he would not comply with the admoni-
tion, he was deposed from his office.

Vlll. The portion which they applied to ornament the
sacred edifices, at first was very small; and even after the
Church was become a little more wealthy‚ they did not excaed
moderatiori in this respect: whatever money was so employed,
still continued to be held in reserva for the poor, is any pressing
necessity should occur. Thus, when famine pravailed in the
province of Jerusalem, and there was no other way of relieving
their wants, Cyril sold the vessels and vestments, and expend-
ed the produce in purchasing sustenance for the poor. ln like
manner, when vast numbers of the Parsiana were almost pe·
rishing with hunger, Acatius, bishop of Amida, after haring
convolred his clergy, and made thot celebrated speech, ‘⁴ Our
God has no need of dishes arnapa, because he neither sats nor
drinks,'’ melted down the vessels, and couverted them into
money, to redeam tha wretched, aud buy food for them. Je-
rome also, while he invcighs against the excessivo splendunt
of the temples, makes hononrable mention of Exuperius, at that
time bishop of Thoulouse, who administered the emblem of
our Lord’s body iu a wicker basket, and the emblem of his
blood in a glass, but suffered no poor person to endure hunger.
'Phe same that 1 have just said of Acatiua, Ambrose relatas of
himself ; for when he was censured by the Adana for having
broken up the sacred vessels to pay the ransom of some cap
tives, he made the following most excellent defence: ‘⁴ He who
sent forth the apostles without gold, gathered Chnrches to·
gether likewise without gold. 'l'he Ohurch has gold, not to
keep, but to expend, and to furnish relief in necessities. What
need is there to keep that which is of no service? Do not we
lrnow how much gold and silver the Assyrians plundered from
the temple of the Lord? ls it not better that it should be
melted down by the priest for the susteuance of the poor, if
other resources are wanting, than that it should be carried away
bya sacrilegious enemy? Will not the Lord say, Wherefore
hast thou suffered so many poor to die with hunger, and at the
same time hadst gold, with which thou mightest have supplied
