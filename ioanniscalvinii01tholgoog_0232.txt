Paul writes, that Christ, “ that he might llll all things, gave
some apostles‚ and some prophete, and some evangelista, and
some pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for
the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of Christ:
till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge
of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of
the stature of the fulness of Christ.’' (o) We see that though
God could easily make his people perfect in a single moment,
yet it was not his will that they should grew to mature age,
but rmder the education of the Church. We see the means
expressed ; the preaching of the heavenly doctrine is assigned
to the pastors. We see that all aro placed under the same
regulation, in order that they may submit themselves with
gentleness and docility of mind to be governed by the pastore
who arc appointed for this purpose. lsaiah had long before
described the kingdom of Christ by this character: “My Spirit
that is upon thee, and my words which 1 have put in thy
mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth
of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed’s seed, from
heneeforth and for ever.'' (p) Hence it follows, that all who
reject the spiritual food for their souls, which is extended to
them by the hands of the Church, deserve to perish with hun·
ger and want. lt is God who inspires us with faith, but it is
through the instrumentality of the gospel, according to the
declaration of Paul, “that faith cometh by hearing.'' (q) So
, also the power to save resides in God, but, as the same apostle
testifica in another place, he displays it in the preaching of the

’ gospel. With this design, in former ages he commanded so-

lemn assemblies to be held in the sanctnary, that the doctrine
taught by the mouth of the priest might maintain the unity of
the faith; and the design of those magnificent titles, where the
temple is called God’s “ rest,'’ his “ sanctuary,” end ‘⁴ dwelling·
plece,'' where he is said to “ dwell between the cherubim,'' (ry
was no other than to promote the esteem, love, reverence, an

dignity of the heavenly doctrine3 which the view of a mortal
and despised man would otherwise greatly diminish. That
we may know, therefore, that we have an inestimeble treasura
communicated to us from earthen vessels, (s) God himself
comes forward, and as he is the Author of this arrangement, so
he will be acknowledged as present in his institution. There·
fore, after having forbidden his poople to devote themselves to
auguries, divinatione, magical arts, neeromancy, and other su·
perstitions, he adds, that he will give them what ought to be
sufficient for every purpose, namely, that he will never leave
