of the apostlcs. The immediate designation of Paul, by the
Lord himself, to this peculiar privilege, was nevertheless accom-
panied with the form of an ecclesiastical call, for Luke states,
that “As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy
Ghost said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work where·
unto I have called them.’' (r) What end could be answered by
this separation and imposition of hands after the Holy Spirit had
testified their electiori, unless it was the preservation of the order
of the Ohurch in designating ministers by meu? God could
not sanction that order, therefore, by a more illustrious example
than when, after having declared that he had constituted Paul
the apostle of the Gentiles, he nevertheless directed him to be
designated by the Church. 'Phe same may be observed in the
election of Matthias. (s) For the apostolic office being of such
high importance that they could not venture to fill up their num·
ber by the choice of any oue person from their own judgment,
they appointed two, one of whom was to be chosen by lot;
that so the election might obtaina positive sanction from Heaven,
and yet that the order of the Ohurch might not be altogether
neglected.

XV. Here it is inquired, whether a minister ought to be
chosen by the whole Church, or only by the other ministers
and the elders who preside over the discipline, or whether he
may be appointed by the authority of an individual. These
who attribute this right to any one man, quote what Paul says to
Titus: “ For this cause 1 left thee in Crete, that thou shouldst
ordain elders in every city; '' (t) and to Timothy: “ Lay hands
suddenly on uo man.'’ (v) But they are exceedingly mis·
taken, if they suppose that either Timothy at Ephesus, or
Titus in Crete, exercised a sovereign power to regulete every
thing according to his own pleasure. For they presided over
the people, only to lead them by good end selutarycounsels, not
to act alone to the exclusion of all others. But that this may
not be thought to be an invention of mine, 1 will prove it by a
similar example. For Luke relatas, that elders were ⁸ordeined
in the Churches by Paul and Barnabas, but et the same time he
distinctly marks the manner in which this was done, -namely,
by the suffreges or votes of the people3 for this is the meaning
of the term he there employs -χειροτονησανης «gerentem κατ’ ἐκκλη-
σιαν. (w) 'Phose two apostles‚ therefore, ordainedthem3 but the
whole multitude, according to ‚the custom observed in electioris
among the Greeks, declared by the elevation of their hands
who was the object of their choice. So the Roman historiens
frequently speak of the consul, who held the assemblies, as
