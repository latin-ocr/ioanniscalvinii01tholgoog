equestrian by purple habits and round shoes, and the eques·
trien from the plebeian by a ring; as French and English ships
of war are known by flags of different colours, the French flags
being white and the English red3 so we have our signs or
badges to distinguish us from unbelievers. But from the ob·
servations already rnade, it is evident that the ancient fathers,
who gave our signs the name of sacraments, were not at all
guided by the previous use of this word in Latin writers; but
that they gave it a new sense for their own convenience,
simply denoting sacred signs. And if we wish to carry our
researches any further, it may be found that they transferred
this name to the signification now given, on the same principle
of analogy which induced them to transfer the word saith to
the sense in which it is now used. For as faith properly signi-
fies truth in the fulfilment of promiseS, yet they have applied
it to the assurance or certain persuasion which a person has of
the truth itself; so, as a sacrament is an oath by which a sol·
dier binds himself to his leader, they have applied it to the sign
by which the leader receives soldiers into his army. For by
the sacramenta the Lord promises that he will be our God, and
that we shall be his people. But we pass over such subtleties,
as I think Ι have proved by sufficient arguments that the
ancients had no other view, iu their application of the word
sacrament, than to signify that the ceremonies to which they
applied it were signs of holy and spiritual things. We admit
the comparison deduced from external badges, but we cannot
bear that the lest and least use of the sacramenta should be
represented es their principal aud even sole object. 'Phe first
objectos them is, to assist our faith towards God; the second,
to testify our confession before meu. 'Phe similitudes which
have been mentioned are applicable to this secondary design,
but the primery one ought never to be forgotten3 for otherwise,
as we have seen, these mysteries would cease to interest us,
unless they were aide of our faith, and appendices of doctrine,
destined to the same use and end.

XIV. On the other hand, we require to be apprized, that
as these persons weakeu the force of the sacraments, and
entirely snbvert their use, so there are others of a contrary
party, who attribute to the sacramente I lrnow not what latent
virtues, which are nowhere represented as communicated to
them hythe word of God. By this error the simple and inex·
perienced are dangerously deceived, being taught to seek the
gifts of God where they can never be found, and being gradu-
ally drawn away from God tc embrace mere vanity instead of
his truth. For the sophistical schools have maintained, with
oue consent, that the sacramenta of the new law, or those now

Ι used in the Christian Ghurch,justify aud confer grace, provided
