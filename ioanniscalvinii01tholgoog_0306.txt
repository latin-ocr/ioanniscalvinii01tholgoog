the temples at the present day? Whatever is conformable,l

do not say to that primitive frugality‚ but to any honourable ψ

mediocrity, is rejected. Nothing pleases, but what savours of
the profusion and corruption of the present times. At the same
time they are so far from feeling any just concern for the living
temples, that they would suffer thousands of the poor to perish
with hunger, rather than convert the smallest chalice or silver
pitcher into money, to relieve their wants And, not of myself
to pronounee any thing more severe, I would only request my
pious readers to indulge this one reflection. If it could happen
that Exuperius—that bishop of 'I'oulouse whom we have
mentioned, — if Aeacius, if Ambrose, or any other such, —should
be raised from the dead, what would they say? In such
extreme necessity of the poor, they surely would not approve
of the riches of the Church being applied to another use, and
that an unneeessary one. 1 forbear to remark, that these pur·
poses for which they are employed, even if there were no poor,
are in many respects injurious, but of no utility whatever. But
lwill not appeal to the authority of men. The property has
been dedicated to Christ, and therefore ought to be dispensed
according to his will. It will be useless for them to allega, that
this portion has been employed for Christ, which they have
squandered in a manner inconsistent with his command. To
confess the truth, however, there is not much of the ordinary
ravenue of the Ghurch lost in these expensas. For there are no
bishoprics so opulent, no abbeys so rich, in short, uo benefiees
so numerous or ample, as to satisfy the voraciousncss of the
priests. Wishing to spare themselves, therefore, they induce
the people, from superstitious motives, to take what ought to be
bestowed upon the poor, and apply it to the building of
temples, the erectiori of statues, the purchase of chalices and
shrines for relies, and the provision of costly vestments. This
is the gulf which swallows up all the daily alms.

XIX. Of the revenue which they derive from lands aad
possessions, what can l say more than Ι have already said,
and which is evidcnt to the observation of all men? We see
with what fidelity the priucipal portion is disposed of by those
who are called bishops and abbots. What folly is it to seek
here for any ecclesiastical order! Was it reasonable that they,
whose life ought to be an eminent example of frugality, mo·
desty, temporanee, and humility, should emulate the pompos
princes, in the number of their attendants, the splendour of
their palaces, the elegance of their apparel, and the luxury of
their tables? And how very inconsistent it was with the office
of those whom the eternal and inviolable decree of God forbids

to be greedy of filthy luere, (q) and commands to be content
