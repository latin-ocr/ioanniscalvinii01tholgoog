essert, that not only our persons, but even our works, are justi·
fied by saith alone Now, if this righteousness os works,
whatever be its nature, is consequent and dependent on saith
and gratuitous justifiedtion, it ought to be included under rt,
and subordinated to it, as an effect to its cause3 so sar rs it
stom deserving to be exalted, either to destroy or to obscure
the righteousness os saith. 'l'hus Paul, to evince that our
blessedness depends on the mercy os God, and not on our
works, chiefly urges this declaration os David: ‘⁴ Blessed are
they whose iniquities are forgiven, and whose sins are covered.
Blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not imputa sin.'' (d)
1f,in opposition to this, the numerous passages be adduced
where blessedness seems ιο be attributed to works; such as,
“ Blessed is the man that seareth the Lord ; (e) that heth mercy .
on the poor ; (s J that wallreth not in the counsel os the un·

godly ; (g) that endureth temptation ; ” (Ιι) “ Blessed are they

that keep judgment;(i) the undefiled,(lc) the poor in spirit,

the meek, the meroisul,” dec. 3 (l) they will not at all wecken

the trnth of what is advanced by Paul. For since no man

ever attains all these characters, so as thereby to gain the Divine

the beatitudes celebrated in the Scripturas are of no avail, and

no man can darive any benefit from them, till he has obtained

blessedness by the remissiori os his sins, which then makes

room for the other beatitudes, it follows that this is not

merely the noblest and principal, but the only blemdness3

unless, indeed, we suppose it to be diminished by those which

are dependent on it. Now, we have much less reason to be

disturbed hythe appellationes righteous, which is generally

given to believers. Ι acknowledge that they are denomi-

nated righteous from the sanctity os their lives, but as they

rather devote themselves to the pursuit os righteousness than

actually attain to righteousness itselt', it is proper that this

righteousness, such as it is, should be subordinate to justifica·

tion by saith, from which it derives its origin.

XI. But our adversaries say that we have yet more difficulty
with James, since he contradicts usin express terms. For he ’
teaches, that “Abraham was justified by works,” and that we
are all “justified by works, and not by saith only.'’ (m) What
then? Will they draw Paul into a controversy with James?
ll they consider James as a minister os Christ, his declaratione
must be understood in some sense not at varianee with Christ
