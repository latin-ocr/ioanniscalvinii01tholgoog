silence, he who is capable of understandiug the truth may be
deceived by falsehood.’' and condensing this sentiment after·
wards into a smeller compass, he places it in a still stronger
light. “ Wherefore, if the apostles and the succeediug teachers
of the Ghurch both piously treated of God's eternal election,
and held believers under the discipline of a pious life, what
reason have these our opponents, when silenced by the inviu-
cible force of tmth, to suppose themselves right in maintaining
that what is spoken of predestination, although it be true, ought
not to be preached to the people? But it must by all means
be preached, that he who has ears to hear may hear. But who
has them, unless he receives thern from him who has promised
to bestow them? Certainly he who receives not may reject,
provided he who receives, takes and drinkS, drinks and lives.
For as piety must be preached that God may be rightly wor-
shipped, so also must predestinatiou, that he who has ears to
hear of the grace of God, mayglory in God, and not in himself.”
XIV. And yet, being peculiarly desirous of edification, that
holy man regulates his mode of teaching the truth, so that
offense may aa far as possible be prudently avoided. For he
suggests that whatever is asserted with truth may also be de·
livered in a suitable manner. lf any one address the people in
such a way as this, If you believe not, it is because you are by
a Divine decree already destined to destruction-he not only
cherishes slothfulness, but even encourages wickedness. lf'any
one extend the declaration to the future, that they who hear
will never believe because they are reprobated, —this would be
rather imprecatiou than instruction. Such persons, therefore, as
foolish toachers, or inauspicious, ominous prophets, Augustino
charges to depart from the Ohurch. In another place, indeed,
he justly maintains, “ that a man then profits by correction, when
he, who causes whom he pleases to profit even without correc-
tion, compassiouates and assists. But why some iu one way,
and some in another? Far be it from us to ascribe the choice
to the clay instead of the potter.’' Again afterwards: “When
men are either introduced or restored into the way of right·
eousness by correction, who works salvation in their hearts,
but he who gives the increase, whoever plants and watersl
he whose determination to save is not resisted by any free· Ἰ
will of man. lt is beyond all doubt, therefore, that the will of
God, who has done whatever he bas pleased in heaven and in
earth, aud who has done even things that are yet future, cannot
possibly be resisted by the will of man, so as to prevent the
execution of his purposes; since he controls the wills of men
according to his pleaaure.’' Agaiu: “When hedesigns to bring
