the other articles of their faith. For the first inventors of the
local presence were unable to explain how the body of Christ
could be mixed with the substance of the brcad, without being
immediately embarrassed by many absrudities. Therefore
they found it necessary to have recourse to this fiction, that
the bread is transmuted into the body of Christ3 not that his
body is properly made of the brcad, but that Christ annihilates
the substance of the brcad, and conceals himself under its form.
lt is astonishing that they could fall into such ignorance, and
even stupidity, as to promulgate such a monstrous notiou, in
direct opposition to the Scripture and to the doctrine of the
primitive Chureh. 1 confess, indeed, that some of the ancient
writers sometimes used the word conversios, not with a view
to destroy the substance of the external signs, but to signify
that the bread dedicated to that sacrament is unlilre common
bread, and different from what it was before. But they all
constantly and expressly declare, that the sacred supper con·
sists of two parts, earthly and heavenly; and the earthly part
they explain, without the least hesitation, to be bread arrd
wine. Whatever the Romanists may pretend, it is very clear
that the authority cf the ancients, which they frequently pre·
sume to oppose to the plain word of God, affords them no
assistance in the support of this dogma; and, indeed, it is
comparatively but of recent invention, for it was not only
unknown to those better times, when the doctrine of religion
stillllourished in its purity, but even when that purity had
already been much corrupted. There is not one of the ancient
writers who does not acknowledge in express terms that the
consecrated symbols of the supper are bread and wiue; though,
as we have observed, they sometimes distinguish thern with
various titles, tc celebrate the dignity of the mystery. For
when they say, that asecret conversiva takes place in the
consecration, so that they are something different from bread
and wine, l have already stated their meaning to be, not that
the bread and wine are annihilated, but that they are to be
considered irr a different light from common aliments, which are
merely designed for the nourishment os the body ; because, in
those elements, we are presented with the spiritual meat aud
drink of the soul. ln this we also coincide. But, say our
opponente, if there be a conversion, one thing must be changed
into another. If they mean that something is made what it
was not before, I agree with thern. lf they wish to apply this
to their absurd notion, let them tell me what change they think
takes place in baptism. For in that also the fathers state a
wonderful conversion, when they say, that from the corrupt·
ible clement proceeds a spiritual ablution of the soul, yet not
one cf them denies that it retains the substance ol water. But
