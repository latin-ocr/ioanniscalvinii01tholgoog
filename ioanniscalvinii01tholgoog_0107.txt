and the same number of precious stones before his hreast; but
that the people should stand without in the court, and there
unite their prayers with those of the priest. (g) 'l'he use of
the sacrifice was to render their prayers effectual. The mean·
ing, therefore, of that shadowy ceremony of the law was, that
we are all banished from the presence of God, and therefore
need a mediator to appear in our name, to bear us on his
shoulders, and bind us to his breast, that we may be heard in
his person; and, nroreover, that the sprinkling of his blood
purifies our prayers, which have been asserted to bc otherwise
never free from defilement. And we see that the saints, when
they wished to obtain any thing by prayer, founded their hope
on the sacrifices, because they knew thern to be the confirma·
tions of all their prayers. David says, “The Lord remember
all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt-sacrifice.'' (lt) Hence
we conclude, that God has from the beginning been appeesed
by the intercession of Christ, so as to accept the devotions of
believers. Why, then, does Christ assign a new period, when
bis disciples shall begin to pray in his name, but because this
grace, being now become more illustrious, deserves to be more
strongly recommended to us? In this same sense he had just
before said, “Hitherto ye have asked nothing in my name;
ask.” (i) Not that they were totally unacquainted with the
office of the Mediator, (since all tha Jews were instructed in
these first principles) but because they did not yet clearly
understand that Christ, on his ascension to heaven, would be
more evidently the advocate of the Cburch than he was before.
Therefore, to console their sorrow for his absence with some
signal advantage, he claims the characteres an advocate, and
teaches them that they have hitherto wanted the principal
benefit, which it shall be given them to enjoy, when they
shall call upon God with greater freedom in a reliance on his
intercessi0n3 as the apostle says that this new way is con·
secrated by his blood. (lc) So much the more inexcuseble is
our perverseness, unless we embrace with the greatest alaerity
such an inestimable benerit, which is particularly destined
forus.

XIX. Moreover, since he is the only way of access by
which we are permitted to approach God, to them who deviate
from this road, and desert this entrance, there remains no other
way of access to God, nor any thing on his throne but wrath,
judgment, aud terror. Finally, since the Father has appoint-
ed him to be our Head and Leader, they who in any respect
decline or turn aside srorn him, endeavour, as far as they can,
to defece and obliterate a character impressed by God. Thus
