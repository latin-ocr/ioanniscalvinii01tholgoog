cipline, as Augustino observes in disputing with the Donatista,
that private persons, if they see saults corrected with too little
diligence by the council ol elders, should not on that account
immediately withdraw from the Church; and that the pastore
themselves, il they cannot succeed according to the wishes of
their hearts in reforming every thing that needs correction,
should not, in consequence of this, desert the ministry, or
disturb the whole Church with unaccustomed asperity. For
there is much truth in his observation, that “ whoever either
correcte what he can by reproos3 or what he cannot correct,
excludes, without breaking the bond os peace; or what he
cannot exclude, without breaking the bond os peace, censures
with moderatior] and bears with lirmness3 he is free from the
curse, and chargeable with no blame.’² In another passage he
assigns the reason ; because “all the picus order and methodos
ecclesiastical discipline ought constantly to regard the uuity of
the Spirit in the bend of peace ; which the apostle commanda
to be kept by mutual forbearance, and without the preservation
of which, the medicine os chastisemeut is not only superfluous,
but even becomes pernicious, and consequently is no longer a
medicine.'’ Again : “He who attentively considers these things
neither neglecte severity of discipline sor the preservation of
unity, nor breaks the bond os fellowship by an intemperance of
correction.'' He acknowledges indeed that it is not only the
duty ol the pastors to endeavour to purify the Church [rom
every fault, but that it is likewise incumbent on every indi·
vidua to exert all his induence sor the same purpose3 and he
fully admits, that a person who neglects to admonish, reprove,
and correct the wicked, though he neither favours them nor
unitos in their sius, is nevertheless culpsble in the sight of the
Lord; but that he who sustains such an office as to have
power to exclude them from a participation of the sacranients,
aud does it not, is chargeable‚ in that case, not with the guilt
of another, but with a sin oi his own3 be only recommends
it to hedone with the prudence required by our Lord, “lest
while ’¹ they “ gather up the tares‚” they ‘⁴ root up also the when
with them.''(p) Hence he concludes with Cypriae, “Let a
man, therefore, in mercy correct what he can3 what he cammt,
let him patiently bear and affecnonately lament.”

XII. 'I’hese remarks ol Augustino were made inconsequence
os the rigour os the Donatists, who, seeing vices in the Ghuroh,
which the bishops condemned by verbal reprooss, but did not
punish with excommunication, which they thought not adaptad
to produce any good efforts, inveighed in a most outrageous
manner against the bishops, as betrayets os discipline, and by
an impleus schism separated themselves from the floet d
