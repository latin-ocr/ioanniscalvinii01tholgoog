though they are instruments used by God for the preservation
of human society, by the exercise of justice, continence, friend-
ship, temperance, fortitude, and prudence, yet they perform
these good works of God very improperly3 being restrained
from the commission of evil, not hya sincere attachment to
trne virtue, but either by merc ambition, or by sels-love, or by
some other inegular disposition. These actions, therefore,
being corrupted in their very source by the impurity of their
hearts‚ are no more entitled to be classed among virtues, than
those vices which commonly deceive mankind by their allinity
and similitude to virtues. Resides, when we reniember that
the end of what is right is always to serve God, whatever is
directed to any other end, can have no claim to that appella-
tion. Therefore, since they regard not the end prescribed by
Divine wisdom, though an act performed by thern be externally
and apparently good, yet, being directed tc a wrong end, it
becomes sin. He concludes, therefore, that all the Fabricii,
Scipios, and Catos, in all their celebrated actions, were guilty
of sin, inasnruch as, being destitute of the light of faith, they
did not direct those actions to that end to which they ought to
have directed thern, that consequently they had no genuine
righteousness; because moral duties are estimated not by ex-
temal actions, bnt by the ends for which such actions are
designed.

that “he that hath not the Son of God, hath not life ; ” (c)
they who have no interest in Christ, whatever be their cha·
racters, their actions, or their endeavours are constantly ad-
vancing‚ through the whole course of their lives, towards
destruction and the sentence of eternal death. On this ar-
gument is founded the following observation of Augustius:
“ Our religion discriminates between the righteous and the un-
righteous, not hythe law of works, but by that of saith, without
which worlrs apparently good are perverted into sins.” Where-
fore the samc writer, in another place, strikingly compares thc
exertions of such men to a deviation in a race from the pre·
scribed course. For the more vigoronsly any one runs out of
the way, he recedes so much the further from the goal, and
becomes so much the more unfortunate, Wherefore he con·
tends, that it is better to halt in the way, than to run out of the
way. Finally, it is evident that they are evil trees, since with-
out a participation of Christ there is no sanctification. They
may produce fruits fair and beautiful to the eye, and even sweet
to the tastc, but never any that are good. Hence we clearly
perceive that all the thoughts, meditatione, and actions of man,
