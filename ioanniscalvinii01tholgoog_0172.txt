11. These things will amply suffice for persons of piety and
modesty‚ who remember that they are men. But as these vir·
ulent adversaries are not content with one species of opposition,
we will reply to them all as occasion shall require. Foolish
mortals enter into many contentione with God, as though they
could arraign him to plead to their accusatione. lu the first
place they inquire, by what right the Lord isangry with his
creaturas who had not provolred him by any previous offence;
for that to devote to destruction whom he pleases‚ ismore
like the caprice of atyrant than the lawful sentence of a judge;
that meu have reason, therefore, to expostulate with God, if
they are predestinated to eternal death without any demerit
of their own, merely by his sovereign will. If such thoughts
ever enter the minds of pious men, they will be sufficiently
enabled to break their violence hy this one consideration, how
exeeedingly presumptuous it is only to inquire into the causes
of the' Divina will; which is in fact, and is justly entitled to
be, the cause of every thing that exista. For ifit has any
cause, then there must be something antecedent, on which it
depends; which itis impious to suppose. For the will of God
isthe highest rule of justiee; so that what he wills must be
considered just, for this very reason, because he wills it.
When it is inquired, therefore, why the Lord did so, the an-
swer must be, Because he would. But if you go further, and
ask why he so determined, you are in search of something
greater and higher than the will of God, which can never be
found. Let human temerity, therefore, desist from seeking
that which is not, lest it should fail of finding that which is.
This will be a sufficient restraint to any one disposed to reason
with reverence concerning the seerets of his God, Against
the audaciousness of the impious, who are not afraid openly to
rail against God, the Lord will sufficiently defend himself by
his own justice, without any vindication by us, when, depriv-
ing their consciences os every subterfuge, he shall convict them
and bind them with asense of their guilt. Yet we espouse
not the notion of the Romish theologians concerning the ab·
solute and arbitrary power of God, which, on account of its
profaneness, deserves our detestation. We represent not God
as lawless, who is alaw to himself ; because, as Plato says,
laws are necessary to men, who arethe subjects of evil desires;
hut the will of God is not only pure from every fault, but the
highest standard of perfection, even the law of all laws. But
we deny that he is liable to be called to any account; we deny
also that we are proper judges‚ to decide on this cause accord·
ing to our own apprehension. Wherefore, if we attempt to
go beyond what is lawful, let us be deterred by the Psalmist,
