referring to the gross abominatione by which they have at·
tempted to overturn all piety; but they would never pretende
failure in any one of the most insignificant traditions to be such
an atrocious crime, unless they made the worship of God sub-
ject to their inventione. Wherein are we guilty of any offence,
then, if we cannot bear in our day what was declared to be
intolerable by Paul: narnely, that the legitimate mode of
worshipping God should be regulatcd by the will of men;
especially when they enjoin a worship “after the rudimenta
of the world,'’ which Paul asserts to he “not after Christ.'’ (y)
lt is well known also, with what rigorous necessity they bind
men’s consciences to observa every thing that they command.
ln our opposition to this, we unite ina common cause with
Paul, who would by no means allow the consciences of be-
lievers to be subjected to the bondage of men. (z)

men have begun to place religion in such vain figmenta that

time of the year, than to have lived a most iniquitous life for a
whole year together; to have infected the tongue with the
least teste of animal food on a Friday, than to have polluted
the whole body by committing fornication every day3 to have
put a hand to any honest labour on a day consecrated to any
pretended saint, than to have continually employed all the
members in the most flagitious actions, for a priest to be con·
nected in one lawful marriage, than to be defiled with a thou·
saud adulteries; to have failed of performing one vow of pil·
grimage, than to violate every other promise; not to have
lavished any thing on the enormous, superfluous, and useless
magnificence of Chmches, than to have failed of relieving the
most pressing necessities of the poor; to have passed by arr
idol without some tohen of honour, than to have insulted all
the men in the world; not to have muttered over, at certain
seasons,a multitude of words without any meaning, than to
