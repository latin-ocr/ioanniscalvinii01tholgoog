that many os them have be'en invented by avaricious priests,
merely as contrivances for the extortion of money. But what·
ever be their origin, they are all so prostituted to the acquisition
of gain, that it is necessary to abolish the priucipal partos them,
if we wlsh to prevent a profane and sacrilegious traffic from
being carried on in the Church.

ol perpetual application respecting human constitutions, because
the preceding observations have been wholly directed to the
present age, yet nothing has been advanced which would not
be useful in all ages. For whercver this superstition intrudas,
that men are determined to worship God with their own inven-
tions, all the laws made for this purpose presently degenerare into
such gross abuses as we have described. It is acurse which God
denounces, not against any particular age, but against all ages,
thet hc will strilrc with blindness and stupidity all those who wor-
ship him with the doctrines os men. (l) The invariable effect os
this blindness is, that no absurdity js too great to be embraced
by persons who, in contempt of so many wernings from God,
wiliully entangle themselves in such fatal suares But is, irre·

the ceremonias by their multitude, obscure the simplicity of the
gospel; that they tend to no edification, but are useless aud
ridiculous occupations rather than real exercises oi piety; that
they are employed for the sordid purposes os dishonest gaiu;
that they are too difficult to be observed; that they are pollu-
tcd with impious superstitious ; — these things will further assist
us in discovering the vast evil which they contain.

XVII. I hear the answer which they make — that their tradi·
tions are not from themselves, but from God; sor that the
Church is directed by the Holy Spirit, so that it cannot err3
and that they are in possession of his authority. When this
point is gained, it immediately follows, that their traditions are
the revelations os the Holy Spirit, which cannot be despised
without impiety and contempt of God. That they may not
appear to attempt any thIng without high authorities, they wish
it to be believed thet the greatest pert of their observances have
