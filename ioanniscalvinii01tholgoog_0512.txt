and foundation, to which the others may be referred. But
having treated these points more at large in discussing the dif-
ference of the Old and New Testamenta, l touch the more
slightly upon them here.

Xll. In the mention of the children they lind this variety;
that under the Old Testarnent, those were called the children
of Abraham, who derived their natural descent from him3 but
that now this appellation is given to those who imitate his

faith3 and that, therefore, that carnal infancy, which was .

ingrafted into the fellowship of the Church by circumcision,
prefigured those spiritual infante of the New Testament, who
by the word of God are regenerated to an immortal life.
In this language we discover, indeed, a small spark of truth3
but it is a great error of these persons, that while they
lay hold of whatever first comesto their hands, when they
ought to pursue it much further, and to compare many things
together, tlrey pertinaciously insist on a single word, hence
it necessarily happens that they are often deceived, be·
cause they acquire no solid knowledge of any thing. We
confess that the natural seed of Abraham did fora time hold
the place of those spiritual children which are incorporated
with him by faith. For we are called his children, notwith-
standing there is no natural relationship between him and us.
But if they understand, as they certainly do, that no spiritual
blessing was ever promised by God to the carnal seed of
Abraham, they are greatly deceived. It behoves us to aim at
amore correct sentiment, to which we are directed by the cer·
taio gnidance of the Scriptura. 'I'he Lord, therefore, promised
to Abraham, that he should have a Seed, in whom all the nations
of the earth were to be blessed, and accompanied this promise
withanassurancethat hewouldbe aGod to him, and to his
seed. All those, who by faith receive Christ, the Author of
the blessing, are heirs of this promise, and are therefore de·
nominated “children of Abraham.'’

XllI. Though, after the resurrection of Christ, the bouada·
ries of the kingdom of God began to be extended far and wide
into all nations, without any distinction, that, according to the
declaration of Christ, believers might be collected “ from the east,
and srom the west, and from the north, and from the south,’' to
“ sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,’' (g) in the glory
of heaven, yet he had embraced the Jews with this great mercy
for many ages before; and because he had passed by all others,
and selected this one nation, to be for a season the exclusive ob·
jects of his grace, he called them his “ peculiar treasure ’² and
“special people.'' (b) ln attestation os this beneficence, the Lord
