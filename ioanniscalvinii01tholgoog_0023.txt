of servitude, he was under an obligation to do; since he be·
longs to ns, with all the ability he has. I say nothing of the
nature of the supererogatione which these men wish to boast
of before God; for they are contemptible trifles, which he has
never commanded, which he does not approve, nor, when they
render up their account to him, will he accept them. We
cannot admit that there are any works of supererogation, ex·
cept such as those of which it is said by the prophet, “ Who
heth required this at your hand?’' (y) But let them remem-
ber the language of another passage respecting these things:
“Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not breed?
and your labourfor that which satisfieth not ? ” (z) lt is easy,
indeed, for these idle doctors to dispute conceming these things
in easy chairs3 but when the Judge of all shall ascend the
judgmeut seat, all such empty notious must vanish away.
The object of our inquiries ought to be, what plea wo may
bring forward with confidence at his tribunal, not what we can
invent in schools and cloisters.

XVI. On this subject our minds require to be guarded
chiefly against two pernicious principles-'Phat we place no
confidence in the righteousness of our works, and that we
ascribe no glory to them. 'Phe Scripturas every where drive
us from all confidence, when they declara that all our right·
eousnesses are odious in the Divina view, unless they are per·
fumed with the holiness of Christ 3 and that they can only
excite the veugeance of God, unless they are supported by his
merciful perdon. Thus they leave us nothing to do, but to
deprecate the wrath of our Judge with tha confession of David,
“ Euter not into judgment with thy servant; for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified.'’ (a) And where Job says,
“ IfI be wicked, woe unto me; and if 1 be righteous, yet will
1 not list up my head ; ’' (1)) though he refers to that consum·
mate righteousness ol' God, compared to which even the angela
are deficient, yet he at the same time shows, that when God
comes to judgment, all men must be dumb. For he not only
means that he would rather freely recede, thau incur the dan·
ger of contending with the rigour of God, hut significa that,he
experiences in himself no other righteousness than what would
instantaneously vanish before the Diviue presence. When
confidence is destroyed, all boasting must of necessity bc re·
linquished. For who can give the praiso of righteousness to 4
his works, in which he is afraid to confide in thc presence of
God? We must therefore have recourse to the Lord, iu whom
we are assured, by lsaiah, that “all the seed of Israel shall be
justified, and shall glory; ”(c) sor it is strictly true, as he
