cnm. xxv] emerita materna. 203

for our minde to rest upon, provided we are not wearied or die·
turbed by the long delay; because it is not oure to measure
the momente of time by our own inclination, but to wait pa·
tiently for God’s establishment of hie kingdom in his own
appointed time. 'I'o this purpose is the expression of Paul,
“Christ the first-fruits, afterward they that are Christ’s at his
coming.’' (g) But that no doubt might be entertained of the
resurrection of Christ, on which the resurrection of us all is
founded, we see in how many and various ways he has caused
it to be attested to us. Scomers will ridicule the history nar-
rated by the evangeliste, as a childieh mockery. For what
weight, they ask, is there in the message brought by some
women ina fright, and afterwards confirmed by the disciplas
half dead with fear? Why does not Christ rather set up the
splendid trophies of his victory in the midet of tha temple and
the public places? Why does he not malre a formidable ea-
trance into the presence of Pilate? Why does he not prove
himself to be again alive, to the priests and all the inhabitants

. of Jerusalem? Profane men will scarcely believe the persone

selected by him to be competent witnessee. Ι reply, notwith-
standing the contemptible weakness evidont in these begin·
nings, yet all thie was conducted by the admirable providence
of God, that they who were lately diepirited with fear, were
hurried away to the sepulchre, partly by love to Christ and piour
zeal, partly by their own nubelief, not only to be eye-witneseesof
the fact, but to hear from the angele the earne as they saw with
their eyes. How can we suspect the authority of those who

considered what they heard from the women “ae idle talea,'’ ,

till they had the fact clearly before them? (lt) As to the pao·
ple at large, and the governor himself, it is no wonder that
after the ample conviction they had, they were denied a sight
of Christ, or any other proofs. The sepulchre is scaled, a
watch is set, the body is not found on the third day. The
soldiers, cormpted by bribes, circulate a rumonr that he wn
stolen away by his disciplee; (i) as if they had power to collect
a strong force, or were fumished with arms, or were even ae·
customed to such adaring exploit. But if the soldiers had not
courage enough to repulse them, why did they not ptrrsue
thern, that with the assistance of the people they might saise
some of them? 'Phe truth is, therefore, that Pilate by his zeal
attested the resurrection of Christ; and the guarde who wera
placed at the sepulchre, either by their silence or by their falsa·
hood, were in realityso many heralde to publish the same fact
In the mean time, the voice of the angele loudly proclaimed,
“He is not hera, but is risen.” (k) Their celestial splendour
