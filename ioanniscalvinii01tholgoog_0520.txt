010 sufficiently conspicuous to repress the opposition and de·
traction of the impious. For though infanta, at the time of
their circumcision, did not understand the meaning of that
sign, they were nevertheless truly circumcised iuto the mortifi-
catiou of their corrupt and polluted nature, which they were
to pursue in mature years. In short, this objection may be
auswered without any difficulty, by saying that they are bap·
tized into future repentance aud faith; 101 though these
greces have not yet been formed in them, the seeds of both
are nevertheless implanted in their hearts by the secret ope·
ration 01 the Spirit. This answer at once overturns every
argument they urge against us, derived from the signification 01
baptism; as when they allege the designation given it by Paul,
where he calls it “the washing df regeneration and renew-
ing 3 ’² (lt) whence they argue that it ought to be given only 10
00011 as are capable of being regenerated and renewed. But
we may reply, on the other hand, neither was circumcision,
which was a sign 01 regeneration, to be given to any but such
as were already regenerated; and this, in their apprehension,
will beto condemn the ordinance of God. Theresore, as we
have suggested several times before, whatever arguments tend
‘equally to invalidate circumcision, can have no force in the
controversy against baptism. Nor cau they escape from any
difficulty, by saying‚ that whatever clearly rests on the au·
thority of God, we ought to consideras fixed and determined,
though we cau discover no reason for it; but that this reve·
100οο is not due to infant baptism, or to other similar things,
which are not enjoined upon us by the express word of God;
for they will always be held fast by this dilemma Either the
command of God, respecting the circumcision 01 infanta, was
legitimate aud liable to no objections, or it was deserviug of
censure. lf there was 00 absurdity in that command, neither
can any absurdity be detected in the practice of infant baptism.

XXI. The charge of absurdity, with which they endeavour
to stigmatize it, we thus refuta: If any of those who are the
objects 01 divine election‚ after having received the sign 01 re·
generation, depart out 01 this life before they have attained
years 01 discretiori, the Lord renovatas thern by the power 01
1110 Spirit, incomprehensible to us, iu such a manner as he
alone foresees will be necessary. If they happen to live to an
age at which they 010 capable of being instructed 10 1110 1100
signification 01 baptism, they will hence be the more inflamed
to the pursuit of that renovation‚ with the token 01 which they
find themselves 10 11ον0 been favoured 10 111011 earliest infaucy,
1110111 might be the object of their constant attention all their
