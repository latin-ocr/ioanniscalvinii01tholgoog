love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy
soul, and with all thy might.” (i) 'I'hat this command may be
fulfilled, our soul must be previously divested of every other
perception and thought, our beart must be freed from all desitas,
and our might must be collected and contracted to this one point.
Those who, compared with others, have made a very consi-
derable progress in the way of the Lord, are yet at an immense
distance from this perfectiori. For though they love God with
their soul, and with sincere affection of beart, yet they have still
much of their beart and soul occupied by carnal desires, which
retard their progress towards God. They do indeed presa
forward with strong exertions, but the flesh partly debilitates
their strength, and partly attracta it to itself. What can they do
in this case, when they perceive that they are so far from ob·
serving the law l They wish, they aspire, they endeavour, but
they do nothing with the perfection that is required. If they
advert to the law, they see that every work they attempt or
meditate is accursed. Nor is there the least reason for any
person to deceive himself, by concluding that an action is not
necessarily altogether evil, because it is imperfect, and that
therefore the good part of it is accepted by God. For the law,
requiring perfect love, condemns all imperfection, unless its
rigour be mitigated. Let him consider his work, therefore,
which he wished to be thought partly good, and he will find
that very work to be a transgression of the lav, because it is
imperfect.

V. See how all our works, if estimated according to the
rigour of the law, are subject to its curse. How, theu, could
unhappy souls apply themselves with alacrity to any work for
which they could expect to receive nothing but a curse? On
the contrary, if they are liberated from the severe exaction of
the law, or rather from the whole of its rigour, aud hear God
calling thern with paternal gentleness, then with cheerfulness
and prompt alacrity they will answer to his call and follow his-
guidance. Iu short, they who are bound bytho yoke of the
law, are like slaves who have certain daily tasks appointed by
their masters. 'I'hey think they have done nothing, and pre-
sume not to enter into the presence of their masters without
having finished the work prescribed to them. But children,
who are treated by their parents in a more liberal manner,
hesitate not to present to them their imperfect, and in some
respects faulty werke, iu confidence that their obedience and
promptitude of mind will be accepted by them, though they
have uot performed all that they wished. Such children ought
we to be, feeling a certain confidence that our services, however
