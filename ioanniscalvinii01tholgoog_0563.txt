Christ always with us; but, with respect to his corporeal pre·
sence, he said with nuth, Me ye have not always with you.
For the Ohnrch had his bodily presence for slew dsys; now
it retains him by saith, but does not behold him with corporeal
eyes.’' Here let ns briessy remark, this father represents
Christ as present with usin three respecta—in his majesty,
his providerrce, and his ineffable grace; under the last of
which 1 comprehend the wonderful communion os his body
and blood; only we must understand this to be effected by
tlre power of the Holy spirit, and not by a fictitious enclosnre
of his body under the breed. For our Lord has declared that
hc has flesh and bones, capable os being selt and seen; and to
go away and to ascend import not a mere appearance of ascent
and departure, but an actual performance os that which the
words express. Shall we, then, it will be said by some, assign
to Christ a particular district os heaven? Ireply, with Augus·
tine, that this question is too auriens, and altogether uuneces-
sacy, provided we believe that he is in heaven, that is enough.
XXVII. Does not the term accession, which is so frequently
repeated, signisy a removal from one place to another? This
they deny, because they consider his exaltatiou as only deno· ·
ting the majesty of his empire. But Iask, What was the man·
uer of his ascent? Was ho not carried up on high in the view
os his disciples? Do not the evangelista expressly state that
he was received np into heaven?(s) These acute sophista
reply that he was concealed from their sight by au interposing
cloud, to teach believers that tlrenoesorward he would not be
visible in the world. As though, to produce a belief ol his
invisible presence, he ought not rather to have vanishsd in a
moment, or to have been enveloped in the cloud without
moving from where he stood. Bnt as he was carried up into
the air, aud, by the interpositiones a cloud between him aud
his disciples, showed that he was no longer to bo sought sor
on earth, we confidently conclude that his resideuce is now in
heaven. This also is affirmed by Paul, who teaches us to ex-
pect hirn from thence. (g) For this reason the angele admo·
nished the disciples - “ Why stand ye gazing up into heaven?
This same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven,
shall so come in like manner as ye have scen him go into
heaven.’' (h) Here also the adversaries of sound doctrine
have recourse to what they think an ingenious evasion-that
he will then become visible who has never departed from the
word, but remained invisible with his people. As though the

angels, in that address, insinuated a twofold presence, aud did
