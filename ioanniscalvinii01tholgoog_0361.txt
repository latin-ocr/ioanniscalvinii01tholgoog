from the statement of Theodoret, that they readily received
what was said by the emperor, it is ¹evident that this novel dog·

Taouoa 1 should concede to our adversaries all the claims
which they set up on behalf of the Church, yet this would
effect but little towards the attainment of their object. For
whatever is said respecting the Church, they immediately
transfer to the councils, which they consider as representing
the Church; and it may further be affirmed, that their violent
contentions for the power of tha Church, are with no other view

councils would furnish us ina great measure with sufficient
arguments for both these objects. '

what is the authority of councils according to the Scriptures,
there is no promise more ample or explicit than this declaration
of Christ: “ Where two or three arc gathored together in my
