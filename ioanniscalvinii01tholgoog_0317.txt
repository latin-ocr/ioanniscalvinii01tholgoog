till the close of his life, to what city shall the second place
be assigned, but to that which was his first see? How came
Alexandria, then, to have the precedence ot' Antioch? Is it
reasonable that the Chu'rch of a mere disciple should be supe·
rior to the see of Peter? If honour be due to every Ohurch
according to the dignity of its founder, what shall we say
of the other Churches? Paul mentions three apostles, “who
seemed to be pillars, James, Peter, and John.’' (s) If the
first place be given to the see of Rome, in honour of Peter,
are not the second and third places due to Ephesus and Jeru-
salem, the sees of John and James? But among the patri·
archates, Jerusalem had the last place, Ephesus could not be
allowed even the farthest corner. Other Ohurches also, as well
those which were founded by Paul, as those over which the
other apostles presided, were left without any distinction. 'Phe
see of Mark, who was only one of the disciples, obtained the
honour. Either let them confess that this wasa preposterous
arrangement, or let them concede to us, that it is not a perpetu·
al mle, that every Chureh should be entitled to the degree of
honour which was enjoyed by its founder.

XIV. All that they say of the settlement of Peter in the
Church of Rome appears to me of very questionable authority.

The statement of Eusebius, that he presided there twenty· ·

five years, may be refuted without any difficulty. For lt
appears, from the first and second chapter to the Galatians, that
about twenty years aster the death of Christ, he was at Jeru-
salem, and that from thence he went to Antioch, where he re-
mained for some time, but it is not certain how long. Gregory
says seven years, and Eusebius twenty-five. But from the
death of Christ to the end of the reign of Nero, under whom
they affirm Peter to have been slain, there were only thirty-seven
years. For our Lord suffered in the eighteenth year of the
reign of Tiberius. lfwe deduct twenty years, during which,
according to the testimony of Paul, Peter dwslt at Jemsalem,
there will remain only seventeen years, which must now be
divided between those two bishoprics. If he continued long
at Antioch, he could not have resided at Rome, except for a
very short time. This point is susceptible of still clearer proof.
Paul wrote his Epistle to the Romans on a journey when he
was going to Jerusalem, (t) where he was seized, and from
whence he was sent to Rome. Itis probable, therefore, that
this Epistle was written four years before his arrival at Rome.
Yet it contains no mention of Peter; which ought on no ac·
count to have been omitted, if he had presided over that Chnrch.
And in the conclusion, where be recites along catalogue of

(ε) Gal. ii. 9. (t) Rom. xv. 25.
