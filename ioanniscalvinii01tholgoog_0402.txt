exist without amagistracy and civil polity, so the Church of
God,aslhave alreadystated, but am now obliged to repeat, stands
in need of acertain spiritual polity; which, however, is entirely
distinct from civil polity, and is so sar from obstructing or
weakening it, that, on the contrary, it highly conduces to its
assistance and advancernent. This power of jurisdiction, there·
fore, will, in short, be no other thau an order instituted sor the
preservation of the spiritual polity. For this end, there were from
the beginning judiciarias appointed in the Churches, to take
cognizance ol manners, to pass censures on vices, and to preside
over the use of the keys in excommunication. This order Paul
designatas in his First Epistle to the Corinthiam, when he
mentions “governments3 ” (n) and to the Romans, when he
says, “ He that ruleth,'’ let him do it “with diligence.'’ (o) He
is not speaking os magistrates or civil governors, sor there were
at this time no Christian magistrates, but os those who were
associated with the pastor in the spiritual government os the
Church. ln the First Epistle to Timothy, also, he mentions
two kinds os presbytera or elders, some “who labour in the
word and doctrine,'' others who have nothing to do with
preaching the word, and yet “rule well.” (p) By the latter
class, there can be uo doubt that he intends those who were
appointed to the cognizance os manners, and to the whole
exercise os the keys. For this power, os which we now speak,
entirely depends on the keys, which Christ has conferred upon
the Church in the eighteenth chapter ol Matthew, where he
commende that those who shall have despised private admoni-
tions shall be severely admonished in the name os the whole
Church; and that is they persist in their obstinacy, they are to
be excluded from the society ol believers. (q) Now, these admo-
nitions and corrections cannot take place without an examination
of the cause3 hence the necessity of some judicatura and order.
Wheresore, unless we would nullisy the promise ot' the keys,
and entirely abolish excommunication, solemn admonitione, and
every thing of a similar kind, it is necessary to allow the Church
some jurisdiction. Let it be observed, that the passage to which
we have referred, relates not to the general authority os the
doctrine to be preached by the apostles‚ as in the sixteenth
chapter of Mathew aud the twentieth chapter of John 3 bnt that
the power ol the sanhedrim is sor the future transferred to the
Chumh os Christ. Till that tirne, the Jews had their own
method of government, which, as lar as regards the pure insti·
tutiori, Jesus Christ established in his Church, and that witha
severe sanction. For this was absolutely necessary, because the
