battle. What has this to do with a sacrifice? Moses praises
the hnmanity and liberality os the pious king; these men
presumptuously fabricate a mystery, of which the Scripture
makes no mention. Yet they varnish their error with another
preterit, because the historiari immediately afterwards says,
“And he was the priest of the Most High God.'' 1 answer, that
they misapply to the bread and wine what the apostle refers to
the benediction, “ For this Melchisedec, priest of the Most
High God, met Abraham and blessed him; '³ from which the
same apostle, than whom it is unnecessary to seek for a better
expositor, argues his superior dignity; “ for without all contra-
diction, the less is blessed of the better.'' (a) But, if the offer-
ing of Melchisedec had been a figure of the sacrifice of the
mass, is it credible that the apostle, who discusses all the
minutest circumstances, would have forgotten a thing of such
high importance? lt will be in vain for them, with all their
sophistry, to attempt to overturn the argument which the

111. A second property of the mass we have stated to be,
that it suppressas and conceals the cross and passion of Christ.
lt is beyond all contradiction, that the cross of Christ is sub·
verted as soon as ever an altar is erected3 for if Christ offered
up himself a sacrifice on the cross, to sanctify us for ever, and
to obtain eternal redemption for us, the virtue and efficacy os
that sacrifica must certainly continue without any end. (y)
Otherwise, we should hare no more honourable ideas of Christ,
than of tha animal victims which were sacrificed under the
law, the oblatione of which are proved to have been weak aud
inefficacions‚ by the circumstance of their frequent repetition.
Wheresore, it must be acknowledged, either that the sacrifice
which Christ accomplished on the cross wanted the virtue of
eternal purification‚ or that Christ has offered up one perfect
sacrifice, once for all ages. This is what the apostle says,
that this great high-priest, even Christ, “ now once, in the end
of the world, hath appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice
of himself.” Again: “By the will of God we are sanctified,
through the offering of tho body of Jesus Christ, once for all.''
Again: “ 'I'hat by one offering Christ hath perfected for ever
them that are sanctified.'' 'I'o which he subjoins this remark-
able observation: ‘¹ 'I'hat where remissiori of iniquities is,
there is no more offering for sin.'' (z) This was likewise
signified by the last words of Christ, when, with his expiring
breath,he said, “lt is finished.'’(a) We are aoeusromed to .
