by those who make a distribution between the grace of God,
and the will aud exertion of man. For they say, that human
desires aud endeavours have no efficacy ot themselves, unless
they are rendered successful by the grace of God; but main·
tain that, with the assistance of his bleasing, these things
have also their share in procuring salvation. Το refuta their
cavil, l prefer Augustine’s words to my own. “ lf the apostle
only meant that it is not of him that willa, or of him that
runs, without the assistance of the merciful Lord, we may
retort the converse proposition, that it is not of mercy alone,
without the assistance of willing and running.'’ lf thisbe mani·
festly impious, we may be certain that the apostle ascribes every
thing to the Lord's mercy, and leaves nothing to our wills or
exertions. This was the opinion of that holy man. Nor is the
least regard ducto their paltry sophiam, that Paul would not
have expressed himself so, if we had no exertiou or will. For
he considered not what was in man; but seeing some persons
attribute salvation partly to human induatry, he simply cou-
demned their error in the former part of the sentence, and in
the latter, vindicated the claim of Divina mercy to the whole
accomplishment of salvation. And what do the propheta, but
perpetually proclairn the gratuitous calling of God?

11. rl'his point is further demonstrated by the very nature
and dispensation of calling, which consists not iu the merc
preaching of the word, but in the accompanying illumination
of the Spirit. To wlrorn God offers his word, we are informed
in the prophet: “I am sought of them that aslred not for ma:
lam found of thern that sought me not: Isaid, Behold me,
behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.’' (b)
And leat the Jews should suppose that this clemency ax·
tended only to the Gentiles, he recalls to their remembrance
the situation from which he took their father Abraham, when
he deigned to draw him to himself ; that was from the nridst
of idolatry, in which he and all his family were sunlr.(c)
When he first shines upon the undeserving with the light of
his word, he thereby exhibita a most brilliant specimen of hia
free goodness. Here, then, the infinite goodneas of God is dia·
played, but not to the salvation of all, for beavier judgmeut
awaita the reprobate, because they reject the testimony of Di·
vine love. And God also, to manifest his glory, withdrawa

from them the efficacious influence of his Spirit. This inter·
nal call, therefore, is apledge of salvation, which cannot possibly
deceive. Το this purpose is that passage of John -“ Hereby
we lruow that he abideth in us, by the Spirit which ho hath
given ua.'’ (d) And last the flesh should glory in having au·
awerad at least to his call, and accepted his free offers, he
