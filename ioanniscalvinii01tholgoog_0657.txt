what laws it may piously nse before God, and be rightly
governed by among men. And even this 1 would have pre·
ferred passing over in silence, if 1 did not know that it is a
point on which many persons run into dangerous errors. For
some deuy that a state is well constituted, which neglects the
polity of MoscS, and is goverued by the common laws of na·
tions. The dangerous and seditious nature of this opinion 1
leave to the examination of others; it will be sufficient for me
to have evinced it to be salse aud foolish. Now, it is necessary
to observe that common distinction, which distributes all the
laws of God promulgated by Moses into moral, ceremonial, aud
judicial; and these different kinds of laws are to be distinctly
examined‚ that we may ascertain what belongs to us, and what
does not. Nor let any one be embarrassed by this scruple, that
even the ceremonial and jndicial precepts are included iu the
moral. For the ancients, who first made this distinction,
were not ignorant that these two kinds of precepts related to
the conduct of moral agents; yet, as they might be changed
and abrogated without affectiug the morality of actions, there·
fore they did not call them moral precepts. They particularly
applied this appellation to those precepts without which there can
be no real purity of rnoralS, nor any permanent rule of a holy life.

XV. The moral law, therefore, with whichl shall begin,
being comprised in two leading articles, of which onesim-
ply commands usto worship God with pur'e saith and piety,
and the other enjoins us to embrace men with sincere love, -
this law, Isay‚ is the true and eternal rule of righteousness,
prescribedto men of all ages and nations, who wish to conform
their lives to the will of God. For this is his eternal and im·
mutable will, that he himself be worshipped by us all, and that
we mutually love one another. The ceremonial law was the
pupilage of the Jews, with which it pleased the Lord to exer·
cise that people during astate resembling childhood, till that
“ fulness of the time ’¹ should come, (z) when he would fully
manifest his wisdom to the world, and would exhibit the reality
of those things which were then adumbrated in figures. 'Phe
judicial law, given to them as a political constitution, taught
them certain rnles of equity arrd justice, by which they might
conduct themselves in aharnrless and peaceable manner towards
each other. And as that exercise of ceremonies properly rela-
ted to the doctrine of piety, inasmuch as it kept the Jewish
Ohurch in the worship and service of God, which is the first
article of the moral law, end yet was distinct from piety itsclf,
so these judicial regulatiouS, though they had no other end
thau the preservation of that love, which is enjoined in the
