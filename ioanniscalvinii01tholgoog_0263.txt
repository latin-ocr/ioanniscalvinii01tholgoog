from others, nor held separate assemblies for prayer. For they
had the express command of God, that they were to assemble
in the temple of Solomon3 and tlrey knew that the [critical
priests, because they had been ordained by the Lord as min·

isters os the sacrifices, arrd had not been deposed, however
unworthy they might be os such honour, still retained the
lawful possessiones that place. But, what is the principal
point of the whole controversy, they were not constrained to
join in any superstitious worship; on the contrary, they en·
gaged in no service that was not ofDivine institution. But what
resemblance is there to this among the Papists? We can scarcely
assemble with them· on a single occasion, without pollnting
ourselves with open idolatry. The principal bond os their com-
munion is certainly the mass, which we· abominate as the
greatest sacrilege. Whether we are right or wrong in this, will
be scen in another place. Itis sufficient, at present, to show
that, m this respect, our case is different from that of the
prophete, who, though they were present at the sacrifices of
impious persons, were never compelled to use, or to witness,
any ceremonies but those which God had instituted Andif we
wish to have an example entirely similar, we must take rt from
the kingdom of lsrael. According to the regulatious of Jeroboam,
circumcision continued, sacrifices were offered, the law was
regarded as sacred, the peoplc invoked the same God whom
their fathers had worshipped; yet, on account of novel cere-
monias invented in opposition to the Divine prohibitions, God
disapproved and condemned all that was done there. Show me
asingle prophet, or any picus man, who even once worshipped
or offered sacrifice at Bethel. They lrnew that they could not

do it without contaminating themselves with sacrilege. We ’

have established this point, therefore, that the attachment of
picus persons to the communiones the Church, ought not to be
carried to such an extent, as to oblige thern to remain in it, if it
degenerated into profane and impure rites.

X. But against their second requisition, we contend upon still
stronger ground. For if the Church be held in such considera-
tion that we are required to revere its judgment, to obey its au-
thority, to receive its admonitione, to sall under its censurcs,
and scrupulously and uniformly to adhere to its communion,
we cannot allow their claim to the character of the Clrurch,
without necessarily obliging ourselves to subjection arrd obe-
dieuce. Yet we readily concede to them what the prophcts
conceded to the Jews and Israelites of their time, when things
among them were in a similar, or even in a better state. But
we sce how they frequently exclaim, that their assemblies were
iniquitous meetings, (w) a concurrence in which were as crimi-

po) nou r. ra 1⁴.
