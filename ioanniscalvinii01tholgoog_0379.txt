God. Now, of this description ara all those which are pre·
tended to belong to the true worship of God, and to be obliga·
tory 011 men's consciences as necessary to be observed. Let
us remember‚ therefore, that all human laws are to be weighed
in this balance, if we would have a certain end infallible test.
The first of these reasons is urged by Paul in his Epistle to the
Colossians, in opposition to the false apostles, who endeavoured
to oppress the Churches with fresh burdens. ln a similar ar·
gument, in the Epistle to the Galatiam, he insists more ou
the second reason. ln the Epistle to the Colossinus, he con·
tende that the doctrine of the true worship of God is not to be
sought from men, because the Lord has faithfully and fully
instructed us how we ought to worship him. To prove this,
in the first chapter he states that all the wisdom by which the
man of God is made perfect in Christ is contained in the gos-
pel. - In the beginning of the second chapter, he declares that
“in Christ are hid cll the treasures of wisdom and knowledge3 '²
from which he concludes that believers should ‘¹ beware lest any
men spoil them through philosophy and vain deceit, ester the
tradition of men.'' At the end of the chapter, he still more
confidently condemns all “will worship ; ’² (ro) this includes all
those fictitious services which men either invent for themselves
or receive from others, together with cll the precepts by which
they presume to regulate the worship of God. Thus wc have
ascertaiued the impiety of all those constitutions, in the obser·
vance of which the worship of God is pretended to consist. The
passages in the Epistle to the Galaticus, in which he argues
that suares ought not to be imposed on consciences, which are
subject to the government of God alone, are too plain to be
mistalren3 especially in the fifth chapter. (c) 11 will there-
fore be sufficient to have mentioned thern.

IX. But ss the whole of this subject will be better eluci·
dated by examples, before 1 proceed any further, it will he
useful to apply this doctrine to our own times. We affirm that
the Ecclesiastical Constitutione, with which the pope and his
satellites oppress the Church, are pernicious end impious; our
adversaries essert thern to be holy and useful. Now, they are
of two classes: some regsrd rites and ceremonies, others have
more relation to discipline. Is there just cause, then, to induce
us to reject both? There certainly is juster cause than we would
desire. ln the first place, do not the authors of them explicitly
declare that the very essence of the worship of God consists in
them? To what end do they refer their ceremonies, but that
God may be worshipped through them ? And this erises not from
the mere error of the uninformed multitude, but from the oppro-
