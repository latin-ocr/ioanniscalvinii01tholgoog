he associates with them all creatures as their companious.
For as ruin and deformity are visible on every side, he tells us
that all things in heaven and earth are tending to renovation.
For the sall of Adam having deranged the perfect order os
nature, the boudage to which the creatures have been subject·
ed by the sin of man is grievous and burdeusome to them; not
that they are eudued with any intelligence, but because they
naturally aspire to the state os perfectiou from which they have
fallen. Paul therefore attributes to theru groaning and travail·
ing pains, (y) that we who have received the first-fruita os the
Spirit may be ashamed of remaining in our corruption, and not
imitating at least the inanimata elements which bear the punish·
ment of the sinos others. But as a still stronger stimulus
tous, he calls the second advent of Christ “our redemption.”
It is true, indeed, that all the parts os our redemption are
already completed; but because “Christ was once offered to
bear the sins of many, he shall appear the second time without
sin unto salvation.⁷' (z) Whatever calamities oppress us, this
redemption should support us even till its tull consummation.

Paul justly argues, that “if there be no resurrection of tha
dead,’' the whole gospel is vain and fallacious3 for we should
be “os all men the most miserable,’' being exposed to the
hatred and reproaches of mankind, “standing in jeopardy
every hour,'' (a) and being even like sheep destined to the
slaughter3 and therefore its authority would sall to the ground
not in one point only, but in every thing it contains relating to
adoption and the accomplishment ol our salvation. To this
subject, the most important, os all, let us give an attention
never to be wearied by length of time. With this view 1 have
deferred what Ι shall briefly say os it to this place, that tha
reader, after receiving Christ as the Author os complete salva·
tion, may leam to soar higher, and may know that he is in·
vested with heavenly glory and immortality, in order that the
whole body may be conformed to the Head; as in his person
the Holy Spirit frequently gives an example of the resurrection.
It is a thing difficult to be believed, that bodies, after having
been consumed by corruption, shall at length, at the appointed
time, be raised again. Therefore, while many of the philoso-
phers asserted the immortality of the soul, the resurrection
os the body was admitted by few. And though this sur·
nishes no excuse, yet it admonishes us that this truth is too
difficult to command the assent os the human mind. 'I'o en·
able saith to surmount so great an obstacle, the Scriptura sup-
plies us with two assistances: one consiste in the similitude os
