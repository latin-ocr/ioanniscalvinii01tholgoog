and very easy to observe.'' The immense distance of this
sirnplicity from the multitude and variety of rites in which we
see the Church now involved, can hardly be stated in terms
sufficiently strong. l know with what artifice some ingenious
men apologiza sor this corruption. They say, that there are
great numbers among usas ignorantes there were among the
Israelites3 that for their sakas such discipline was instituted,
which those who are stronger, though they do uot find it
necessary, ought not to neglect, when they perceive it to be
usesul to their weak brethren. l reply, that we are not ignorant
of what is due froin every Christian to the infirmity of his
brathren; but, on the other hand, we reply, that this is not the
way to benefit the weak, hy oppressing thern with heavy loads
of ceremonias. lt was not without causa that the Lord has
made this differenca between his ancient people and us; that
he chose to instruct thern, like children, with emblems and
figures, but hasbeen pleascd to teach us in amore simple
manner, without such a large external apparatus. As “ achild,'’
says Paul, “ is under tutors and governors until the time appoint-
ed ofthe father,” (s ) so the Jews were under tha instruction and ῃ
govemment os tha law. But we resemble adults, who, having
left astate of tuition and guardianship, have no need of puerile
discipline. Surely the Lord forasaw what sort oscommon people
there would bein his Church, and in what manner they would
require to be governed. Yet ha made the difference we have
mentioned between us and tha Jews. lt isat'oolish way, there·
fore, to pretend 'to benefit tha ignorant by reviving Judaism,
which has bean abrogated by Christ. This diversity, between
the people under theold dispensation and the new, was signified
by Christ, when he said to the woman of Samaria, “The hour
cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship
the Father in spirit and in truth.'’ (g) This, indeed, had always
bean the case, but the new worshippers differ from tha ancient
in this respect, that under Moses the spiritual adoration os God
was concealed, and in some degree embarrassed with many
ceremonias, which being now abolished, he is worshipped with
greater simplicity. Wheresore those who eonfound this differ·
anca, subvert the order instituted and established by Christ.
Shall no ceremonias, than, it will be asked‚ be given to the
ignorant, to assist their weaknessl Isay no such thing; sor
lthink some assistance of this kind very usesul to them.
l only contend that such means should be employed as would
tend to make known Christ, not to conceal him. God has,
therefore, given us few ceremonias, and those byrro means
η laborious, to exhibit Christ to us as present; tha Jews had a
