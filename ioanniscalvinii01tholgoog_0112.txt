to superintend the concerns os our salvadeu, whose province it
is to keep us in all our ways, who surround us, who ad·
vise and comfort us, who watch over us; all of which offices
are committed to angels, but not to departed saints. (l) How
preposterously they include dead saints with angels, fully
appears from so many different functions, by which the Scrip-
ture distinguishes some from others. No man will presumo,
without previous permission, to act the part of an advocate
before an earthly judge: whence, then, have worms so great a
license to obtrude on God as intercessors those who are not
recorded to have been appointed to that office? God· has
been pleased to appoint the engeis to attend to our salvation,
whence they frequent the sacred assemblies, and the Church
is to thern a theatra, in which they admire the various and
“manifold wisdom of God.”(rn) These who transfer to
others that which is peculiar to them, certainly confound and

stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this peo-
ple.'’ (n) How, they say, could he thus have spoken concern·
ing persons deceased, unless he knew that they were accus·
tomed to intercede for the living? But l, on the contrary,
deduce this conclusion—Ther since it appears that neither
Moses nor Samuel interceded for the Israelites, there was then
no intercession of the dead. For who of the saints must wc
believe to be concamed sor the salvation of the people‚ when
this ceases to be the ease with Moses, who far surpassed all ’
others in this respect while alive? But if they pursne such
minute subtleties, that the dead intercede for the living, because
the Lord has said, “Though they interceded,” Ι shall argue,
with far greater plausibility, in this manner- ln the people’s ex·
treme necessity, no intercession was made by Moses, of whom it
is said, Though he interceded. Therefore it is highly probable,
that no intercession is made by any other, since they are all so
far from possessing the gentleness, hindness‚ and paternal solici-
tude of Moses. This is indeed the consequence of their cavil-
ling, that they are wounded with the same weapons with which
they thought themselves admirably defended. But it is very
ridiculous, that a plain sentence should be so distorted3 only
because the Lord declares that he will not spare the crimes of
the people‚ even though their cause had been pleaded by
Moses or Samuel, to whose prayers he had shown himself so
very propitious. This idea is very clearly deduced from a
similar passage of Ezelriel— “ 'Phough these three men, Noah,
