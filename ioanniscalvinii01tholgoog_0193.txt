also supported David when his saith was sailing: “Thou wilt
not forsake the work of thine own hauds.'' (z) Nor is it to be
doubted, that when Christ intercedes sor all the elect, he prays
sor them the same as for Peter, that their saith may never fail.
Hence we conclude, that they are beyond all danger of falling
away, because the intercessione ol the Son os God lor their
perseverance in piety have not been rejected. What did Christ
intend we should learu from this, but confideuce in our per-
petual security, since we have once been introduced into the
number of his people?

VII. But it daily happens, that they who appeared to belong
to Christ, sall away from him again, aud sink into ruin. Even
in that very place, where he asserts that none perish ol those
who were given to him by the Father, he excepta the sou ol
perdition. This is true; but it is equally certain, that such
persons never adhered to Christ with that confidence os heart

Besides, he is not addressing individuale, but distinct parties
generally. For as the Church was divided into two parties,
and emulation gave birth to dissensiou, Paul admonishes the
