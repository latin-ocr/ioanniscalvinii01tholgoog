philosophy, which cannot be extracted from syllogisms; but
is well understood by those whose eyes God has opened, that
in his light they may see light. But since we have been
taught by saith to acknowledge, that whatever we want for
the supply of our necessities is in God and our Lord Jesus

Christ, in whom it has pleased the Father all the sulness of his
