of the Church? 'Phey call the Greeks schismatica. For what
reason? Because, it is pretended, they have lost their privi-
lege by revolting from the Apostolical see. But do not they
much more deserve to lose it, who have revolted from Christ
himself? 11 follows, therefore, that their plea of uninterrupted
successiorr is a vain pretence, unless the truth of Christ, which
was transmitted from the fathers, be permanently retained pure
and uncorrupted by their posterity.

111. 'Phe pratensions of the Romanists, therefore, in the
present day, are no other than those which appear to have been
formerly set up by the Jews, when they were reproved by the
prophets of the Lord for blindness, impiety‚ and idolatry. For
as the Jews boasted of the temple, the ceremonies, and the
priesthood, in which things they firmly believed the Church to
consist; so, instead of the Church, the Papists produce certain
external forms, which are often at a great distance from the

permanent seat, yet when the priests had corrupted his wor-
ship by perverse superstitious, he departed, and left the place
without any sanctity. If that temple which appeared to be
consecrated to the perpetual residence of God, could be forsakea
arrd desacrated by him, there can be no reason for their pre·
tending that God is so attached to persons or places, or confined
to external observances‚ as to be constrained to remain among
those who have nothing but the name and appearance of the
Church. And this rs the argument which' rs maintained by
Paul ((1 the Epistle· to the Romans, from the ninth chapter to
the twelfth. For rt had violently disturbed weak consciences,
to observe that, while the Jews appeared to be tha people of
God, they not only rejected, but also persecuted, the doctrine
of the gospel. Therefore, aster having discussad that doctrine,
ha removes this difficulty3 and denies the claim of those Jews,
who were enemies of the truth, to be considered as the Church,
though in other respecta they wanted nothing that could be
requisita to its external form. And the only reason for this
denial was, because they did not receive Christ. He speaks
rather more explicrtly in the Epistle to the Galatians, (l) where,
