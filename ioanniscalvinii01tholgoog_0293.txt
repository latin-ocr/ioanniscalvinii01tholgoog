forsmaller vices than these. But the greatest absurdity of all is,
tltat even boys, scarcely ten years of age, have by the pennission
of the pope been made bishops. And to such lengths of impu·
dence and stupidity have they proceeded, as not to be afraid of
that extreme and monstrous enormity, which is altogether re-
pugnant to the common sense of nature. Hence it appears
how solemn and conscientious must have been their electioris,
which were marked with such extreme negligence.

ll. All the right of the people to choose has been entirely
taken away. Their suffrages, assent, subscriptions, and every
thing of this kind, have disappeared. All the power is trans·
ferred to the canons. They confer the bishopric on whom
they plesse, and then produce him before the people, but to be
adored, not to be examined. Leo, ou the contrary, exclaims
that no reason permits this, and pronouuees it to be a violent
imposition. When cyprian declares it to be of Divine right,
that an election should not be made without the consent of the
people, he shows that a different method is repugnant to the
word of God The deerees of various councils most severely
prohibit it to be done iu any other way, and if it hedone,
commandit to be void. lf these things be true, there is now
no canonical election remaining in ull the Papacy, either accord·
ing to Divine or ecclesiastical right. Now, though there were
no other evil, how will they be able to excuse themselves for
having thus deprived the Church of her right? But they say,
the corruption of the times required, that as the people aud
magistrates, in the choice of bishops, were rather carried away
by antipathies and partialities than gevemed by an honest and
correct judgment, the decision of this business should be in·

· trusted to a few. let it be admitted that this was an extreme

remedy for a disease under desperate circumstances. Yet as
the medicine has been found more injrnious than the disease
itself, why is there no remedy provided against this new mala·
dy? They reply, The canons themselves have been particularly
directed what course they ought to pursue in au election. But
do we doubt, that the people formerly understood themselves
to be bound by the most sacred laws, when they saw the word
of God proposed as their rule, whenever they assembled for the
election of a bishop? For that one declaration of God, in
which he describes the true character of a bishop, ought to have
more weight than millions of canons. Yet, corrupted by a
most sinful disposition, they paid no regard to law or equity.
So in the present day, though there are the best written laws,
yet they remain buried in paper. At the same time, it has
been the general practice, and, as if it were founded in reason,
bas obtained the general approbation, that druukards, forni-
catura, aud gamblers, have been promoted to this honour.
