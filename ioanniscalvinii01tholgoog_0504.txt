of baptism, and thence he will also learii tlie reason and use
of the external sprinkling. Oii the other hand, he who con-
temptuously disregards these things, and confines his attention
entirely to the visible ceremony, will understand neither the
force nor propriety of baptism, noi everi the meaning or use of
the water. This sentiment is established by testimonias of
Scripture too numerous and clear to leave the least necessity
for pursiiing it any further at present. It reinains, therefore,
that from the promises given iii baptism, we endeavour to de-
duce its nature and meaning. 'Phe Scriptura shows, that the
first thing represented init, is the remissiori and purgatiori of
sins, which we obtain in the blood of Christ ; and the second
the mortificationof the flesh, which consists in the participa-
tion of his death, by which believers are regenerated to new-
ness of life, and so into communion with him. This is the
sum to which we may refer every thing delivered iii the Scrip-
tures concerning baptism, except that it is also a sign by
which we testify our religion before men.

Ill. As the people of God, before the institution of baptism,
had circumcision instead of it, let iis examine the similarity
and difference between these two signs, in order to discover ,
how far we may argue from one to the other. When the
Lord gave Abraham the command of circumcision, he prefaced
it by saying, “I will be a God unto thee, and to thy seed aster
thee 3 ’² at the same tima declaring himself to be “ Almighty,’'
having ari abundance of all things at his disposal, that Abraham
might expect to find his hand the source of every blessing. (z)
These words contain the promise of eternal life, according to
the interpretation of Christ, who deduces froin this declaration
an argument to evince the immortality aiid resurrection of be-
lievers. “ F'or God,’' says he, “is not the God of thedoad,
but of the living.’' (a) Wherefore also Paul, iii showing the
Ephesians froin what misery the Lord had delivered them,
concludes, froin their not having been admitted to the cove-
nant of circumcision, that “at that time ” they “ were without
Christ, strangers froin the covenants of promise, having no hope
and without God ; '' (b) all these things being comprehended iii
that covenant. But the first access to God, the first entrance
into immortal life, is the remissiori of sius. Whence it follows
that this promise corresponds with the promise of baptism re·
specting our purgatiori. vhe Lord afterwards stipulated with
Abraham, that he should walls before him in sincerity aiid
purity of hoart: thls belongs to mortification, or regeneration.
