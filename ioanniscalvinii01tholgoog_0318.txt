picus persons to whom he sends his salutations‚ where, in short,
he enumeratas all that were known to him, he still says not a
word of Peter. (υ) 11 is unnecessary 10 use any long or laboured
arguments with persons 01 sound judgment3 for the case itself,
aud the whole argument of the Epistle proclaims, that if Peter
had been at Rome, he ought not to have been omitted.

XV. Paul was afterwards brought as 1 prisoner to Rome.
Luke says that he was received by the brethren, but says
nothing of Peter. (w) From that city Paul wrote to several
Ghurches. Iu some 01 these epistles he introduces salutations‚
in the names of certain brethren who were with him ; but they
coutain not 1 single word implying that Peter was there at that
time. Who will think it credible that, if hc had been there,
Paul could have passed him over iu total silence? Moreover,
in his Epistle to the Philippians, after having said that he had
110 one who discovered such sincere concern respecting the
work of the Lord as 'Pimothy‚ he complains that “all seek
their own.''(c) And to Timothy himself he makes yet a
heavier complaint: “At my first answer no man stood with
me, but all meu forsook me.’' (y) Where was Peter then?
For 11 they say that he was at Rome, how deep is the igno· ·
miny which Paul fixes upon him, that he was a deserter 01 the
gospcl? For he is speaking 01 the faithful, because headda
his prayer, “ that it may not be laid to their charge.’' How
long, then, and at what time, did Peter hold that see ? lt will
be said, it is the uniform opinion of ancient writers, that he
governed that Ohurch till his death. But those writers them·
salves are not agreed who was his successor. Some say it was
Linus; and others, clement. 'I'hey likewise relate many ab·
surd aud fabulous stories respocting the disputatiou held between
him and Simon Magus. And Augustine, when treatiug 01
superstitious, acknowledges that the custom, which obtained at
Rome, of not fasting on the day on which Peter gained the
victory over Simon Magus, arose from an opinion entertained
without any sufficient authority. ln the last place, the traus-
actions of that age are so perplexed by a variety of representa·
tions, that we must not give implicit credit 10 every thing that
is recorded. Yet, in consequence 01 this agreement of the
ancient writers, 1 will not disputa his having died at Rome;
but that he was bishop there, aud especially for any considera·
ble time, is what I cannot be persuaded to believe. Noram 1
anxious respecting this point, because Paul testifies that the
apostleship of Peter particularly belonged 10 the Jews, and that
his own was directed to us. To add our confirmation, thera·
fore, to the compact which they established between them·
