nistration every year. For when the canons invariably repre·
sent the bishop as the dispenset of all the benefactions of the
Church, it is not to be understood as if he executed that charge
himself, but because it belonged to him to give directions to
the deacon, who were to be entirely supported from the funda
of the Church, to whom the remainder was to be distributed,
andin what proportion to each person; and because he had
the superintendence over the deacon, to examine whether he
faithfully discharged his office. Thus the carious, ascribed to
the apostlcs, contain the following injunction: “We ordain
that the bishop do have the property of the Church in his
own power. Forif the souls of men, which are of superior
value, have been intrusted to him, there is far greater proprie·
ty in his taking charge of thc pecuniary concems; so that all
things may be distributed to the poor by his authority through
the presbyters and deacons, and that they may be administered
with reverence, and all concem.’' And in the Oouncil of An-
tioch it was decreed‚ that those bishops should be censured
who managed the pecuniary concerns of the Ohurch without
the concurrence of the presbyters and deacons. But it is
unnccessary to argue this point any further, since it isevident
from many epistles of Gregory, that even in his time,
when the administrationes the Church was in other respecta
become very corrupt, yet this custom was still retained, that
the deacons were the stewards for the relief of the poor,
under the authority of the bishop. It is probable that sub-
, deaoons were at first attached to the deacons, to assist thern
in transacting the business of the poor; but this distinction
was soon lost. Archdeacons were first erected when the ex·
tent of the property required a new and more aocrrrate mode
of administration ; though Jerome states that there were such
offices even iu his time. ln their hands was placed the amount
of the annual revenues, of the possessione, and of the house-
hold furniture, and the management of the daily contributione.
Whence Gregory denounces to the archdeacon of Thessalo-
nica, that he would be held guilty, if any of the property of the
Church should be lost by him, either through negligence or
fraud. Their appointment to read the gospel, and to exhort
the people to pray, and their admission to the administratiou of
the cup in the sacred supper, were intended to dignify their
office, that they might discharge it with the more piety, in
consequence of being admonished by such ceremonies, that
they· were not executing some profane stewardship, but that
their function was spiritual and dedicated to God.
