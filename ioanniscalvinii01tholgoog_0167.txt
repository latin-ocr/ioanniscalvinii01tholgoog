merited.” For since the Lord allows us to contemplate nothing
in election but his mere goodness, the desire of any one ιο sec
any thing mora is a preposterous disposition. But is we were
inclined ιο a contention os subtilty, we should be at no loss ιο
resute this petty sophism os Aquinas. He contenda that glory
is in a certain sense predestinated sor the elect according to
their merits, because God predestinates ιο them the grace by
which glory is merited. What if I, on the contrary, reply,
that predestination to grace is subordinate ιο election to lise,
and attendant upon itl that grace ispredcstinated to those ιο
whom the possession of glory has been already assigned; bc·
cause it pleases the Lord ιο conduct his children from electiori
ιο justificationi For hence it will follow, that predestination ιο
glory is rather the cause os predestination to grace, than the
contrary. But let us dismiss these controversus, they are
unnecessary with those who thinlr they have wisdom enough
in the word os God. For it was truly remarked hyan ancient

ecclesiastical writer, 'Phat they who ascribe God’s election to
merits, are wiser than they ought ιο be.

X. lt is objected by some, that God will be inconsistent
with himself, is he invites all men universally to come ιο him,
and receives only a t‘ew elect. Thus, according to thern, the
universality os the promises destroys the discrimination of special

gracc; and this is the language of some moderate men, not so
much sor the sake of suppressing the truth, as to exclude thomy
questions, and restrain the curiosity os many. 'Phe end is laudabla,
but the means cannot be approved ; sor disingenuous evasion can
nevar bc excused; but with those who use insult and invective, it
isa foul cavil or a shameful error. How the Scriptura reconciles
these two facts, that by extamal preaching all arc called to re·
pentance and saith, and yet that the spirit of repentance and saith
isnot given ιο all, 1 have elsewhere stated, and shall soon have
occasion partly to repeat. What they assume, 1 deny, as being
salse in two respects. For he who threatens drought to one city
while it rains upon another, and who denounces to another place
a famine of doctrine, (s) lays himself under no positive obliga-
tion ιο call all men alike. And he who, forbidding Paul to
preach the word in Asia, and suffering him not to go into
Bithynia, calls him into Macedonia, (g) demonstratas his right
to distribute this treasure ιο whom he pleases, ln lsainh, he
still more sully declares his destination os the promises os sal·
vation exclusively sor the elect; sor os thern only, and not
indiscriminately os all mankind, he declares that they shall be
his disciples. (Ιι) Whence it appears, that when the doctrine
os salvation is offered to all sor their effectual benefit, it isa
