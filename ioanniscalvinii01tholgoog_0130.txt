whom proceeds every blessing we enjoy, there ought to be
nothing exclusively appropriated by any among us, but what
vwe should be ready to communicate to each other with the
greatest alacrity of heart, whenever necessity requires. Now,
if we desire, as we ought, to exart ourselves for our mutual
assistance, there is nothing in which we can better promote
the interests of our brethren, than by commending them to the
providential care of our most benevolent Father, with whose
mercy and favour no other want can be experienced. And,
indeed, this is a debt which we owe to our Father himself.
For as he who truly and cordially loves any father of a family,
feels likewise a love and friendship for his whole household,
in the same manner, our zeal and affection towards this hea-
venly Father must be shown towards his people, his family, his
inheritance, whom he has dignified with the honourable appel·
lation of the “sulcem'’ of his only begotten Son. (b) Let a
Christian, then, regulata his prayers by this rule, that they be
common, and comprehend all who are his brethren in Christ;
and not only those whom he at present sees and knows 1ο be
such, but all men in the world, respecting whom, what God
has determined is beyond our knowledge; only that to wish
and hope the best concaming thern, is equally the dictate of
piety and of humanity. 11 becomes us, however, to exercise a
peculiar and superior affection “unto thern who are of the
household of faith;” whom the apostle has in every case re·
commended to our particular regards. (c) In a word, all our
prayers ought to be such, as to respect that community which
our Lord has established in his kingdom and in his family.
XXXIX. Yet this is no objectiou to the lawsulness of par·
ticular prayers, both for ourselves and for other certain indi-
viduals; provided our minds be not withdrawn from a regard
to this community, nor even diverted from it, but refer every
thing to this point. For though the words of them be singular,
yet as they are directed to this eud, they cease not to be com·
mon. All this may be rendered very intelligible by a simili·
tude. God has given a general command to relieve the wants
of all the poor; and yet this is obeyed hy them who 1ο that
end succour the indigenae of those whom they either know or
see to be labouring under poverty; even though they pass by
multitudes who are oppressed with necessities equally severe,
because neither their knowledge nor ability can extend to all.
In the same manner, no opposition is made to the Divine will
by them who, regarding aud considering this common society
of the Ohurch, present such particular prayers, in which, with
apublic spirit, but in particular terme, they recommend to God
