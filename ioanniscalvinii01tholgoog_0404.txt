doctrine which he had delivered to them. On the other hand,
also, it was necessary that the most unequivocal testimony
should be given to their hearers, that the doctrine of the gospel
was not the word of the apostles, but of God himself ; not a
voice issuing from the earth, but descended from heaven. Por
these things, the remissiori of sins, the promise of eternal life,
and the message of salvation, cannot be in the power of man.
Therefore Christ has testified that, in the preaching of the gospel,
nothing belonged to the apostles, except the ministration of it;
that it was he himself who spoke and promised every thing by
the instrumentality of their mouths ; and, consequenlly, that the
remission of sins which they preached was the true promise of
God, and that the condemnation which they denounced was
tbe certain judgment of God. NoW, this testification hasbeen
given to all ages, and remains unaltered, to certify and assure us
all, that the word of the gospel, by whomsoever it may happen
to be preached, is the very sentence of God himself, promulgated
from his heavenly tribunal, recorded in the book of life, ratified,
confirmed, and fixed in heaven. Thus we see, that the power
of the keys, in these passages, is no other than the preaching of
tbe gospel, and that, considered with regard to men, it is not so
much authoritative as ministerial; for, strictly speaking, Christ
has not given this power to men, but to his word, of which be
has appointed men to be the ministers.

ΙΙ. The other passage, which we have mentioned, relative
to the power of binding and loosing, is in the eigbteentb chapter
of Matthew, where Christ says, “ Π any brother neglect to hear
the Church, let him be unto thee as a heathen man and a
publican. Verily 1 say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on
earth, shall be bound in heaven ; and whatsoever ye shall loosa
on earth, shall be loosed in heaven.'’ (t) This passage is not
altogether similar to the first, but is to be understood in a
manner somewhat different3 though 1 do not conceive the
differenoe to be so great, but that there is aconsidorable affinity
between them. In the first place, they are both alike in this
respect, that each contains a general declaration, the same power
of always binding and loosing, —that is, by the word of God, -
the same command, the same promise. But they differ in this,
that the former passage peculiarly relatas to the preaching of tbe
gospel, which is performed by the ministers of the word;
the latter relatos to the discipline, which is committed to the
Church. The Church binds him whom it excommunicates3
not that it consigna him to perpetual ruin and despair, but be-
cause it condemns his life and manners, and already warns him
of bis final condemnation, unless he repent. The Church
