from the grace of Christ is spiritual; let us,I say, remember
to confine within its proper limits all this liberty which is
promised aud offered to ns in him. For why is it that the
same apostle, who, in one place, exhorts to “stand last in the
liberty wherewith Christ hath made us free, and be not en·
tangled again with the yoke of bondage,'’ (a) in another, en-
joins servants to “care not sor'' their servile condition3 (b)
except that spiritual liberty may very well consist with civil
servitude? ln this sense wc are likewise to understand him
in these passages: “There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is
neither bond nor free, there is neither male nor semale²¹ (c)
Again: “There is neither Greek nor Jew, circumcision nor
uncircnmcision, Barbarion, Scythian, band nor free: bnt Christ
is all, aud in all; '³ (d) in which he signifies, that it is ol no
inrportance, what is our condition among men, or under the
laws os what nation we live, as the kingdom of Christ consists
not in these things.

ΙΙ. Yet this distinction does not lead us to consider the
whole system os civil government as a polluted thing, which
has nothing todo with Christian men. Some fanatice, who
are pleased with nothing but liberty, or rather licentiousness
without any restraint, do indeed boast and vociferate, 'rhat
since we are dead with Christ to the elements of this world,
and, being translated into the kingdom ot' God, sit among
the celestials‚ it is a degradation to us, and far beneath
our dignity, to be occupied with those secular and impure
cares which relate to things altogether uninteresting toa Christ·
ian man. Os what use, they ask, are laws without judgments
and tribunale? But what have judgments to do with a Christ-
ian man? And is it be unlawsul to kill, os what nse are laws
and judgments to us? But as we have just suggested that
this kind of government is distinct from that spiritual and in·
ternal reign of Christ, so it ought to be known that they are
in no respect at variance with each other. For that spiritual
reign, even now upon earth, commences within us some pre·
ludes os the heavenly kingdom, and in this mortal aud trans·
itory lise affords us some prelibations of immortal and incor-
ruptible blessedness3 but this civil government is designed, as
long as we live in this world, to cherish and support the ex-
ternal worship os God, to preserve the pure doctrine of religion,
to defend the constitution ns the Church, to regulare our lives
in a manner requisite for the society of men, to form our man·
ners to civil justice, to promote our concord with each other,
and to establish general peace and tranquillity3 all which 1
