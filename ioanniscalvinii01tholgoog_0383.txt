investigation, they will be found a mere shadow of discipline,
without any reality.

Xlll. Now, to proceed to the other fault which l have
mentioned, who does not see that traditions, hythe continual
accumulation os one upon another, have grown tosuch an
immense number, that they are altogether intolerable to the
Christian Church? Hence it is, that the ceremonias discover
a kind of ludaism, and other observances inflict grievous torturas
on pious souls. Augustius complained that, in his time, the
commands of God were neglected, and every thing was so full
of presumptiou, that a person was more severely censured for
having touched the ground with his hare feet within eight
days of his baptism, than for having drowned his sensas iu
intoxication. He complained that the Church, which the
mercy os God intended to place in astate os liberty, was so
grievously oppressed, that the condition of the Jews was more
tolerable. Is that holy man had lived in our day, with what
lamentations would he have deplored the present state oi
bondage? For the number of ordinances is ten times greater,
and every tittle is enforced with a hundred times more rigour,
than in his time. Such is the general consequence, when these

is linely expressed by Paul, when he says, “ lf ye be dead from

The word aba, signifying both to eat and to handle, requires
here to bc understood in the former sense, to avoid an unneccs-
sary repetition. Here, then, he most beautifully describes the
progress of the false apostles. They begin with superstition,
forbiddiug to eat not only a large quantity, but even a little ;
when they have carried this point, they noxt forbid to taste;
and after this is submitted to them, they pronounce it unlawful

. even to touch witha finger.

XIV. ln the present age, we justly censure this tyranny in
human constitutions, which astonishingly torments miserable
consciences with innumerable edicts, and the extreme rigour
with which they are enforced. 'Phe canons relating to disci·
plina have been already considered. What shall lsay of the
ceremonias, which have halt buried Christ, and caused us to return
to Jewish figures? “Christ our Lord,’' says Augustine, “has
connected together the society of the new people with sacra-
menta, very few in number, most excellent in signification,
