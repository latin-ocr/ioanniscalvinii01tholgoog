name, there am Ι in the midst of them.” (b) But this belongs
no less to every particular congregation than to a general coun-
cil. The main stress of the question, however, does not lie
in this, but in the annexed condition, -that Christ willbe in the
midst of acouncil, then, and then only, when it is assembled in
his name. Wherefore, though our adversaries mention councils
of bishopsa thousand times, they will gain but little ground;
nor will they prevail upon us to believe what they pretend, -
that suchcouncils are directed by the Holy Spirit, - till it shall
have been proved, that they are assembled in the name of
Christ. For it is equally as possible for impious and unfaithful
bishops to conspire against Christ, as for pious and upright
bishops to assemble together in his name. Of thie we have
ample proof in numerous decrees which have been issued by
such councils; as will be seen in the course of this discussion.
At present I only reply in one word, that the promise of Christ
isexclusively restricted to those who “are gethered together
in his name.” letus, therefore, define wherein this consiste.
1 deny that they are assembled in the name of Christ, who,
rejecting the command of God, which prohibite any diminution
of his word, or the smallest addition to it, (c) determine every
thing according to their own pleasure; who, not content with
the eracles of the Scriptura, which constitute the only rule of
perfect wisdom, invent something new out of their own heads.
Since Christ has not promised to be present in all couneils, but
has added a particular mark to discriminate true and legitimate
councils from others, it certainly behoves us by no means to
neglect this distinction. This was the covenant which God
auciently made with the Levitical priests, that they should teach
their people from his mouth ; (d) he always required the same
of the prophets3 and we see that asimilar law was imposed
upon the apostles. 'Phose who violate this covenant, God
neither dignifies with the honour of the priesthood, nor invests
with any authority. Let our adversaries solve this difficulty,
if they wish me to submit my faith to the decrees of men, in·
dependently of the word of God.

Ill. For their supposition, that no truth remeius in the
Ghurch, unless it be found among the pastore, and that the
Ghurch itself stands, no longer than it appears in general coun-
cils, is very far from having been always correct, if the pro·
phets have left us any authentic records of their times. ln the
days ot' lsaiah, there wasa Ohurch at Jerusalem, which God
had not yet forsaken: nevertheless he speaks of the priests in
the following manner: “His watchmen are blind, they are
all ignorant, they are all dumb dogs, they cannot berk; sleep-
