give them life, therefore, he makes them partakers of himself3
while these men, by driving thern away from him, adjudge
them to death. For if they pretend that infanta do not perish,
even though they are considered as children of Adam, their
erroris abundantly refuted by the testimony of Scriptura.
For when it pronounces that “iu Adam all die,'’ (o) it follows
that there remains no hope os life but in Christ. In order to
become heirs of life, therefore, it is necessary for us to be par·
takers os him. So, when it is said, iu other places, that we
are “by nature the children of wrath,’' (w) aud “conceived iu
siu,''(c) with which condemnation is always connected, it
follows, that we must depart from our own nature, to have any
admissiou to the kingdom of God, Aud what can be more
explicit than this declaration, ‘¹ that flesh and blood cannot iu-
herit the kingdom of God ? ’' (y) Let every thing of our own,
therefore, bc destroyed, which will not be affected without re·
generation, and theu we shall see this possession of the kingdom.
Lastly, is Christ speaks the truth, when he declares himself to
be “ lise,’' (z) it is necessary for us to be ingrasted into him,
that we may be rescued from the bondage of death. But how,
it is inquired, are infants regenerated, who have no knowledge
either of good or evil? We reply, that the work of God is
not yet without existence, because it is not observed or under·
stood by us. Now, it is certain that some infants are saved;
and that they are previously regenerated by the Lord‚ is be·
yond all doubt. For if they are born in a state of cormption,
it is necessary for them to be purified before they are admitted
into the kingdom of God, into which “ there shall in no wisa
enter any thing that defileth.'’ (a) If they are born sinuers,
asboth David and Paul affirm, either they must remain unac-
ceptable and hateful to God, or it is necessary for them to be
justified. And what do we require more, when the Judge
himself declares that there is no entrance into the heavenly
life, except for those who are born again i (b) And, to silence
all objectors, by sanctifying John the Baptist iu his mother's
womb, he exhibited an example of what he was able to do for
others. Nor can they gaiu any advantage by their frivolous
evasion, that this was only a single case, which does not justify
the conclusion that the Lord generally acts in this manner
with infants. For we use no such argument. We only mean
to show, that they unjustly confine the power of God within
those narrow limits to which it does not suffer itself to be
restricted. Their other subterfuge is equally weak. They
allego that, according to the usage of the Scriptura, the phrase
