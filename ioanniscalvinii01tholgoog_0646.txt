For he says, “ 'l'here is no power but ol' God; the powers
that be are ordained of God. Rulers are ministers of God,
revengers to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil, Do that
which is good, and thou shalt have praise ol the same.’'(ll
This is corroborated by the examples of holy men, of whom
some have been kings, as David, Josiah, Hezelriah3 some have
been viceroys, as Joseph and Daniel; some have held civil
offices in a commonwealth, as Moses, Joshua, and the Judges3
whose functions God deelared to be approved by him. Where-
t'ore no doubt ought now to be entertained by any person that
civil magistracy is a calling not only holy and legitimate, but
sar the most sacred and honourable in human life.

V. These who would wish to introduce anarchy, reply, that
though, in ancient times, kings and judges presided over a rude
people, that servile kind of government is now quite incompa-
tible with the perfectiori which accompanies the gospel os
Christ. Here they betray not only their ignorance, but their
diabolieal pride, in beasting of perfectiori, of which not the
smallest particle can be discovered in them. But whatever
their characters may be, they are easily refuted. For, when
David exhorts kings and judges to kiss the Son os God, (m) he
does not command them to abdicate their authority and retire
to private life, but to submit to Christ the power with which
they are invested, that he alone may have the preeminence
over all. ln like manner Isaiah, when he predicta that “ kings
shall be nursing-fathers and queens nursing-mothers’' to the
Ghurch,(n) does not depose them from their thrones3 but
rather establishes them by an honourable title, as patrous and
protectors of the picus worshippers of God, for that prophecy
relates to the advent of Christ. 1 purposely omit numerous
testimonias, which often occur, and especially in the Psalms,
in which the rights of all governors are asserted. But the most
remarkable of all is that passage where Paul, admonishing
Timothy that in the public congregation, “ supplications,
prayers, intercessione, and giving of thanks, be made for liings
and sor all that are in authority,'' assigns as a reason, “ that
we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all godliness and
honesty 3 ’' (o) language in which he recommends the state os
the Church to their patronage and defence.

Vl. This consideration ought continually to occupy the ,
magistrates themselves, since it is calculated to surnish thern
with a powersul stimulus, by which they may be excited to
their duty, and to alsord them peculias consolation, by which
