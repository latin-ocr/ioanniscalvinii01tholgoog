rectiori of tyranrrical dominatron is the vengeance of God, we
are not, therefore, to conclude that it is committed to us, who
have received no other command than to obey and suffer.
This observatiou l always apply to private persons. For if
there be, in the present day, any magistrates appointed for the
protection of the people and the moderatiori of the power of

kings, such as were, in ancient times, the Ephori, who were a
check upon the kings among the Lacedaemouians, or the popu·
lar tribunes upon the consuls among the Romans, or the De·
marchi upou the senate among the Athenians; or with power
such as perhaps is now possessed by the three estates in every
kingdom when they are assembled; 1 am so far from prohibit·
ing them, in the discharge of their duty, to oppose the violence
or cruelty of kings, that 1 affirm, that if they connive at kings
iu their oppression of their people, such forbearance involves
the most nefarious perfidy, because they fraudulently betray the
liberty of the people, of which they know that they have been
appointed protectors by the ordinationes God.

XXXII. But in the obedience which we have shown to be
due to the authority of govemors, it is always necessary to make
one exception, and that is entitled to our first attention, -that it
douot seduee us from obedience to him, to whose will the
desires of all kings ought to be subject, to whose decrees all
their commanda ought to yield, to whose majesty all their
sceptres ought to submit. And, indeed, how preposterous it
would be for us, with a view to satisfy men, to incur the dis·
pleasure of him ou whose account we yield obedience to men!
The Lord, therefore, is the King of kings3 who, when he has
opened his sacred mouth, is to be heard alone, above all, for all,
and before all; in the next place, we are subject to those
men who preside over us3 but no otherwise then in him.
If they command any thing against him, it ought not to have
the least attenti0n; nor, in this case, ought we to pay any
regard to all that dignity attached to magistrates3 tc which no
injury is done when it is subjected to the unrivalled and supreme
power of God. Ou this principle Daniel denied that he had
committed any crime against the king iu disobeying his impi-
ous decree 3 (i) because the king had exceeded the limits of his
office, and had not only done an injury to meu, but, by raising
his arm against God, had degraded his own authority. On the
other hand, the israelites are condemned for having been too
submissive to the impious edict of their king. For when Jero·
boam had made his golden calvas, in compliance with his
will, they deserted the temple of God and revolted to new
’ superstitione. Their posterity conformed to the decrees of

(a) Dan. vik‘l.
