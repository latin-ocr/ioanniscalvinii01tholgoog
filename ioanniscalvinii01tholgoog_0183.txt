vented, that the obedient may not be proud as os any thing os
their own, but may glory in the Lord. Christ had some
particular meaning in saying, “ Who bath ears to hear, let him
hear.'’ (r) Therefore when we exhort and preach, persons en-
dued with ears readily obey; aud those who arc destitute of
them exhibit an accomplishment of the Scripture, that hearing
they hear not. (s) “But why (says Angustiae) should some
have ears, and others not? ‘Who hath known the mind os the
Lord l ² (t) Must that which is evident be denied, because that
which is concealed cannot be comprehended i ” These obser·
vations l have faithfully borrowed from Augustine; bnt as his
words will perhaps have more authority than ruine, I will
proceed to an exact quotation of them. “Is, on hearing this,
some persons become torpid and slothful, and exchanging labour
for lawless desire, pursuc the various objects os concupiscence,

our declaring any such thing, nor are they rendered worse. But
since the truth isos such a nature, that when we speak of it, he
becomes worse who cannot understand it, and when we are silent
about it, he who cau understand it becomes worse,-what do
we think ought to be done? Should not the truth rather be
spoken, that he who is capable may understand it, than buried
in silence3 the consequence os which would be, not only that
neither would know it, but even the more intelligent of the two

we are authorized to say by the testimony of Scriptura. For
we arc afraid, indeed, lest by speaking we may offend him who
