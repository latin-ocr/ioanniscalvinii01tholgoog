to be capable of any sight, and too stupid to be capable of the
least relish of spiritual things. But instead of one favour of
God, which they mention, we acknowledge three. For, first,

the Lord reaches and instructs us by his word; secondly, he
confirms us by his sacraments; lastly, he illuminates our miuds
by the light of his Holy Spirit, and opens an entrance into our
hearts for the word and sacraments; which otherwise would
only strike the ears and present themselves to the eyes, with·
out producing the least effect upon the mind.

IX. With respect to the confirmation and increase of saith,
therefore, 1 wish the reader to be apprized, and Ι conceivel
have already expressed, in language too plain to be misunder-
stood, that I assign this office to tbe sacraments; not from an
opinion of their possessing a perpetual inherent virtue, effica-
cious of itself to the advancement or confirmation os faith3
but because they have been instituted by the Lord for the
express purpose of promoting its establishment and augmenta·
tion. But they only perform their office aright when they are
accompanied by the Spirit, that internal Teacher, by whose
energy alone our hearts are penetrated, our affections are
moved, and an entrance is opened sor the sacramente into our
souls. If he be absent, the sacraments can produce no more
effect upon our minds than the splendour of the sun on blind
eyes, or the sound os a voice on deas ears. Ι make such a
distinction and distribution, therefore, between the Spirit and
the sacraments, that leonsider all the energy of operation as
belonging to the Spirit, aud the sacraments as mere instru-
ments, which, without his agency, are vain and useless, but
which, when he acts and exerts his power in the heart, are
fraught with surprising efficacy. Now, it is evident how, ao-
cording to this opinion, the faith of a pious mind is confirmed
by the sacraments; namely, as the eyes see by the light of the
sun, and the ears hear by the sound of a voice: the light
would have uo effect upon the eyes, unless they had a natural
faculty capable of being enlightened; and it would be in vain
for the ears to be struck with any sound, if they had not been
naturally formed for hearing. But if it be true, as we ought
at once to conclude, that what the visive faculty is in our
eyes towards our beholding the light, and the faculty of hear·
ing is in our ears towards our perception of sound, such is
the work of the Holy Spirit in our hearts for the formation,
support, preservation, and establishment of our faith3 then
these two consequences immediately follow -that the sacra·
ments are attended with no benefit without the influence of
the Holy Spirit; and that, in hearts already instrueted by that
Teacher, they still subserve the confirmation and increase of
faith. There is only this difference, tlrat our eyes aud ears are
