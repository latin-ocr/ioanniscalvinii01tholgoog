and characters which the Lord has deemed sufficiently descrip-
tive of his Church! We sec, however, that great cantion re-
quires to be observed on both sides. For, to prevent imposture
from deceiving us, under the name of the Chureh, every con·
gregation assuming this name should be brought to that proof,
like gold to the touchstone. lf it have the order prescribed by
the Lord in the word and sacramente, it will not deceive us,
we may securely render to it the honour dne to all chnrches.
On the contrary, if it pretend to the name of a Church, with·
out the word and sacraments, we ought to beware of such de·
lusive pretensions, with as much cantion as, in the other case,
we should use in avoiding presumption and pride.

XII. When we affirm the pure ministry os the word, and
pure order in the celebration of the sacraments, to be a suffi-
cient pledge and earnest, that we may safely embrace the soei·
ety in which both these are found, as a true Ghnrch, we carry
the observation to this point, that such a society should never
be rejected as long as it continues in those things, although in
other respecta it may be chargeable with many faults. Itis
possible, moreover, that some fault may insinuate itself into the
preaching of the doctrine, or the administrationes the sacra·
. ments, which ought not to alienate us from its communion.
For all the articles of true doctrine are not of the same de·
scription. Some are so necessary to be known, that they
ought to be nniversally received as fixed and indubitable prin·
ciples, as the peculiar maxims of religion3 such as, that therela
one God; that Christ is God and the Son of God3 that onr
salvation depends on the marey of God3 and the like. There
are others, which are controverted among tha churohes‚ yet
without destroying the unity of the faith. For why should
there be a division on this point, if ona chureh bo of
s opinion, that souls, at their departure from their bodies, are
immediately removed to heaven 3 and another churoh venture
to determine nothing respecting their local situation, but be
nevertheless finnly convinced, that they live to the Lord; and
if this diversity of sentiment on both sides be frea from all
fondness for contention and obstinacy of assertion? The lan·
gnage of the apostle is, “ Let us therefore, as many as be per- ⁸
fect,bethusminded 3 and if inanything ye beotherwise minded,
God shall reveal even this unto you.” (t) Does not this suffi-
ciently show, that a diversity of opinion respecting these non·
essential points ought not to ba a cause of diseord among
Christiana? lt is of importance, indeed, that we should agree
in every thing; bnt as there is no person who is not enveloped
with some cloud of ignoranee, either we must allow of no
