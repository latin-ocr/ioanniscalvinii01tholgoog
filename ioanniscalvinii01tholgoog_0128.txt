never to present aprayer to God but in the name of Christ,
since no other name can recommend it to his regard. For by
calling God our Father, we certainly plead the name of Christ.
For with what confidence could any one call God his Father?
who could proeeed to sacha degree of temerity, as to arrogata
to himself the dignity of a sou of God, if we had not been
adopted as the children of his grace in Christ? who, being his
true Son, has been given by him to us as our brother, that the
character which properly belongs to him by nature, may be·
come ours by the blessing of adoption, if we receive this iu·
estimable favour with a steady faith; as John says, that to
them is given “power to become the sons of God, evento
them that believe on the name of the only begotten of the
Father.'' (q) Therefore he denominates himself our Father,
and wishes us to give him the same appellation; delivering
us from all diffidence by the great sweetness of this name,
since the affection of love can nowhere be found in a stronger
degree than in the heart of a father. Therefore he could not
give us amore certain proof of his infinite love towards us,
than by our being denominated the sons of God. But his love
to usis as much greater and more excellent than all the love
of our parente, as he is superior to all men in goodness and
mercy ; (r) so that though all the fathers in the world, divested
of every emotiou of paternal affection, should leave their chil-
dren destitute, he will never forsalre us, because “he cannot
deny himself.'’ (s) For we have his promise, “ If ye, then,
being evil, know how to give good gists unto your children,
how much more shall your Father which is in heaven?''(t)
Again, in the prophet: “ Can a woman forget her child? Yea,
they may forget, yet will 1 not forget thee.'' (u) But if we are
his sons, then, asason cannot commit himself to the proteo·
tion of a stranger and an alien, without at the same time com·
plaining of the eruelty or poverty of his father, so neither ean
we seek supplies sor our wants fmm any other quarter than
from him, without charging him with indigenca and inability,
’ or with emelty and excessive austerity.

XXXVII. Neither letus plead that we are justly terrified
by a consciousness of our sins, which may cause even a merci·
ful, kind Fathcr to be daily offended with us. For if, among
men, a son can conduct his cause with his father by no better
advocate, can conciliate and recover his lost favotu by no bet·
ter mediator, than by approaching him as an hamble suppliant,
aclrnowlcdging his own guilt, and imploring his father’s mercy,
(for the bowels of a father could not conceal their emotions at
