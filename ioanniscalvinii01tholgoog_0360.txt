man. For they seo how wide a door is opened to the scotis
and eavils of the impious, if we assert that the decisions of

, men ars ιο be received by Christians as articles of saith. lt is
also to be remarked, that Christ spolre according to the estab-
lished order of his own time, and gave this name to the San·
hedrim, that his disciples might learn afterwards to reverence
the solemn assemblies of the Ghurch. And thus, on the prin·
ciple of our adversaries, every city and village would have au
equal liberty ιο frame new articles of saith.

XVl. The examples which they allego are nothing to the
purpose. They say that the baptism of infants arose, not so
much from any express command of Scriptura, as from the
decree of the Chureh. It would be a most miserebis asylum,
if, in defonce of infant baptism, we were compelled to have
recourse to the moro authority of the Chureh3 but it will be
shown in another place, that tho fact is very different. So
when they object, that the Scri ures nowhere affirm what was
pronouneed in the Council of ice, that the Son is of the same
substance with the Pother, they do great injury to the fathers
of that council‚ as if they had presumptuonsly condemned
Arius for having refused to subscribe to their language, while
he professed all the doctrine which is contained in the wri-
tings of the prophets and apostles. 'Phe word mnsubatontial,
(hermog) Ι confess, is not to be found in the Scriptur03 but
while, on the one hand, it is so often affirmed that there is but
one God, and, on the other, Christ is so frequently called the
true and oternal God, one with the Father, what have the Ni·
cene fathers done, but simply expressed the natural sense of
the Scriptura, in declaring the Father arrd the uon to be of one
and the same substance? And Theodoret the historiari states,
that Constantine the emperor opened that eouncil with the fol·
lowing preliminary addresa: “ln disputes on Divine subjecta,
we are ιο adhere ιο the doctrine of the Holy Spirit3 the boolrs
of the evangelista and apostles, with the eracles of the pro·
phets, fully reveal ιο us the will of God. Wherefore, laying
aside all discord, let us talre the decision of all questions in
debate from the words of the Spirit.” There was no one at
that time who opposed these holy admonitione. No one ob·

· jected, that the Charch might add something of its own, that
tho Spirit had not revealed every thing to tha apostles‚ or, at least,
that they had not transmitted the whole to posterity in' writing,
or any thing of the like nature. If what our adversaries con-
tend for be true, in the first place, Constantine acted unjustly
in depriving the Church of its power; and in the next place,
when none of the bishops rose to vindicate that power, their
silence was not to be excused from treachery, for on that occa·
