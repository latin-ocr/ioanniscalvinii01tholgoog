of our interest in eternal life, of which he is the heir, and that
the kingdom of heaven, into which he has already entered, can
no more be lost by us than by him3 and, on the other hand,
that we cannot be condemned by our sins, from the guilt of
which he absolved us, when he wished them to be imputed to
himself, as if they were his own This is the wonderful exchange
which, in his infinite goodness, he has made with us. Submit-
ting to our poverty, he has transferred to us his riches; assum·
ing our wealrness, he has strengthened us by his power, ac·
cepting our mortality, he has conferred on us his immortality3
taking on himself the load of iniquity with which wc were
oppressed, he has clothed us with his righteousness; descend·
ing to the earth, hc has prepared a way for our ascending to
heaven, becoming with us the Son of man, he has mede us,
with himself, thc sons of God.

lll. Of all these things we have such a complete attestation
in this sacrament, that we may confidently consider them as
truly exhibited to us, as if Christ himself were presented to
our eyes, and touched by our hands. For there can be no
falsehood or illusion in this word, “ Take, eat, drink; this is
my body which is given for yon; this is my blood which is
shed for the remission of sins.’' By commanding ns to take,
he signifies that he is ours; by commanding us to eat and
drink, he significa that he is become one substance with us.
In saying that his body is given for ns, and his blood shed for
us, he shows that both are not so much his as oum, because he
assumed and laid down both, not sor his own advantage, but
for our salvation. And it ought to be carefully observed, that
the principal and almost entire energy of the sacrament lies in
these words, “which is given for you;” “which is shed for
you ; ’' for otherwise it would avail us but little, that the body
and blood of thc Lord are distribtrted to us now, if they had
not been once delivered for our redemption and salvation.
Therefore they are represented to us by bread and wine, to
tcach us that they are not only ours, bnt are destined for the
support of our spiritual life. This is what we have already
suggested—that by the corporeal objects which are presented
in the sacrament, wc are conducted, by a kind of analogy‚ to
those which are spiritual. So, when bread is given to us asa
