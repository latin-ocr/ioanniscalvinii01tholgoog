be elevated above itself, that it may not intrude into the Divine
presence any of the imaginations of our blind and foolish reason,
nor confine itself within the limite of its own vanity, but rise
ιο purity worthy of God.

V. Both these things are highly worthy of observation-first,
thet whoever engsges in prayer, should apply all his faculties
and attention to it, and not be distracted, es is commonly the
case, with wandering thoughts; nothing being more contrary
to a reverencs for God than such levity, which indicates a
licenticus spirit, wholly unrestrained by fear. ln this cass our
exertions must be great in proportion to the difficulty we
experienoe. For no man cen bs so intent on praying,but he
may perceive meny irregular thoughts intruding on him, aud
either interrupting, or by some oblique digression reterding, the
course of his devotioris. But here let ιιι consider what sn
indignity it is, when God admits us ιο familiar intercourse with
him, to ebuso such great condescension by a mixture of things
sacred and profane, while our thoughts are not confined to him
by reverential ave; but es if ws were conversing witha mean
mortal, ive quit himin the midst of cur prayer, end make
excursione on every side. We may be essured, therefore, thet
none are rightly prepared for the exercise of prayer, but those
who are so affected by the Divine Maiesty as ιο οοιιιο ιο it
divested of all earthly cares and affections. And this is indi·
cated by the ceremony of lifting up the hands, that men msy
remember that they sre at a great distance from God, unless
they lift up their thoughts on high. As it is also expresscd in
the psalm, “ Unto thee do 1 lift up my soul.” (e) And the Scrip-
tnre frequently uses this mode of expression, “ ιο lift up one's
prayer ; '’ thst they, who desire to be heard by God, may not
sinlr into lethargic insctivity. 'ro snm up the whole, the
greater the liberality of God towards us, in gently iuviting us
to disbnrden ourselves of our cares by casting them on him,
the less excussbls are we, unless his signal and incomparable
favour preponderste with ιιι beyond every thing else, and st·
tract us to him in s serious application of all our faculties end
attention to the duty of prayer; which cannot be done unless
our mind by strenuous exertion rise superior to every impedi·
ment. Our second proposition is, that we must prsy for no
more then God permits. For though he enjoins us ιο pour out
our hearts before him, (s) yet he does not carelessly give the
reins to effectione of folly and depravity; and when he pro·
misas to “fulfil the desire ” (g) of believers, hs does not go
to such an extreme of indulgence, as ιο subject himself to their
caprice. But offences against both these rules are common
