tha stipend ot' servants, bnt the inheritanca of children, which
will be enjoyed only by those whom the Lord adopts as his
children, and sor no other cause tban on account of this adop-
tion. “For the son os the band-woman shall not bo heir with
theson ot' the free-woman.” (t) And, therefore, in the same
passages in which the Holy Spirit promises etemal lisa as the re·
ward os works, byaxpressly denominating it “ an inheritance,”
he proves it to prooeed from another cause. Thus Christ enn-
merates the worka which he comperientes by the reward ot
heaven, when ha calls the elect to the possession os it ; but at
tha same time adds, that it is to be enjoyed by right os inharit·

time calls it ‘¹ the reward of theinheritance.”(1o) We see bow
they, almost in express terme, cantion us against attributing
eternal lise to works, instead os ascribing it to Divina adoption.
Why, then, it may be asked, do they at the same time mairo
mention ot' vorke? This question shall be elucidated by ona
example from the Scriptura. Before the nativity os Isaac,
there had been promised to Abraham a seed in whom all the
natione os the earth ware to be blessed, a multiplicatiori os bis
posterity, which would equal the stara ot' heaven and tho sanda
of the sea, and other similar blessings (a) Many years atter,
in consequence of a Divina command, Abraham preparas to
sacrifice his son. After this act of obedience, ho receives this
promise ε “By myself have Ι swom, saith the Lord, sor because
thou hast done this thing, and hast not withbeld tby son, thina
only son; that in blessing Ι will blesa thee, and in mnltiplying
1 will multiply thy seed as the stara os the heaven, and as the
send which is upon the sea-shore; and thy seed shall possess
the gata olbis enemies; and in thy med shall all the na·
tione of tbe earth be blessed; because thou hast obayed my
voice.’' (y) What? did Abraham by his obedience merit that
blessing which had been promised him before tha command
was delivered? Here, then, it appears, beyond all doubt, that
the Lord rewards the works os bellavere with those blessings
which he had already given them before their works were
thought os, and while he had no reason sor his beneficence,
but his own mercy.

says that he will requite worlrs with what he had sreely giv-
