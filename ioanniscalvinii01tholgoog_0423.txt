when Ambrose excluded him from the privilege of communion,
on account os a massacre perpetrated at Thessalonica, laid aside
the ensigns os royalty with which he was invested, publicly
in the Church bewailed his siu, which the deceitlul suggestions
of others had tempted him to commit, and implored pardon
with groaus and tears. For great kings ought not to think it
any dishonour to prostrate themselves as suppliants before
Christ the King of kings, nor ought they to be displeased at
being judged by the Church. As they hear scarcely any thing
in their courts but mere flatteries, it is the more highly ncces-
sary for them to receive correction from the Lord by the

may have been censured, “lest perhaps such a one should
be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow;’'(m) for thus a
remedy would become a poison. But the rule of moderatiori
may be better deduced from the end intended to be accom-

sinuer may be brought to repentance, and evil examples taken
away, to prevent the name of Christ Irom being blasphemed
and other persons being tempted to Imitation, - is we keep these
