just to apprize the readers, that all the jargon of the sophista
respecting the work brought (opus operatum) is not only false,
but repugnant to the nature of the sacraments; which God
has instituted, in order that believers, being poor and desti·

sovereign as a markos their profession, have not considered
that which was the principal thing in baptism; which is, that
we ought to receive it with this promise, “He that believeth
and is baptized shall be saved.” (t)
