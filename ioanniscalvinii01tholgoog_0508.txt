importance, that Christ commanded infants to be brought to
him, and added, as a reason for this command, “ For os such is
the kingdom of heaven ; '’ and afterwards gave a practical tes·
timony os his will, when, embracing them in his arms, he
commended them to his Father by his prayers and benedic·
tious. If it be reasonable for insants to be brought to Christ,
why is it not allowable to admit thern to baptism, the symbol
of our communion and sellowship with Christ? ls os thern is
the kingdom of heaven, why shall they be denied the sign,
which opens, as ll were, an entrance into the Church‚ that,
being received into it, they may be enrolled among the heirs of
the heavenly kingdom? How unjust shall we be, is we drive
away t'rorn Christ those whom he invites to him; is we deprive
themoi the gifts with which he adorus them 3 it' we exclude
those whom he freely admits! But is we examine how far
what Christ did on that occasion differs from baptism, how
much greater importance shall we attach to baptism, by which
we testify that infante are included iu the eovenant of uod,
than to the reception, the embrace‚ the impositiou of hands,
and the prayers by which Jesus Christ himself acknowledged
them as his, and declared them to be sanctified by him!
'I'he other cavils by which our opponents endeavour to elude
the soree of this passage, only betray their ignorance. For
they argue that as Christ said, “ Suffer little children to come,”
they must have been grown to such an age and stature as to
be capable of walking. But they are called by the evangeliste
Βρεφη and «ardre, two words used by the Greeks to signily little
int'ants hanging on the breast. The word “eom'’ therefore,
is merely used to deuote “ access.'’ To such evasione are
persons obliged to have recourse, who resist the truth. Noris
there any more solidity iu the objection, that the kingdom of
heaven is not said to belong to infante, but to those who resem-
ble them, because the expression is, not of them, but ‘⁴ of such
is the kingdom of heaven.” Foris this be admitted, what
kind of reason would it be that Christ assigns, with a view to
show that infante iu age ought not to be prevented from ap·
proaching him, when he says, “ Suffer little children to come
unto me l '² Nothing can be plainer than that he intends those
who are in a state of real insancy. And to prevent this from
being thought unreasonable, he adds, ‘⁴ Of such is the kingdom
os heaven.'' And is insauts be necessarily eomprehended, it
is beyond all doubt that the word “ ΜΗ designatas both
infante themselves and those who resemble them. (e)

VIII. Now, every one ,must perceive, that the baptismos
infante, which is so strongly supported by the authority ol
Scriptura, is very far from being an invention ot‘ meti.. -· Ι ,
