reprobated with one voice, but also to abuse their testimony in
vindication of the Papacy, which it is evidens was utterly un-
known to them! In the time of Bernard, however, l confess
the corruption was so great that there was no great difference
between that age and the present3 but those who adduce any
pleafor the existing state of things from the time of Leo, Gregory,
and others in that middle period, must be destitute of all shame.
This conduct resembles that of any one, who, to vindicate the
monarchy of the Roman emperors, should commend the ancient
state of the Roman government; which would be no other
than borrowing the praises of liberty to adorn a system of

yr{Xllll Lastly, though all these things were conceded to
them, they would be called toa new controversy, when we
deny that there exists at Rome a Church in which such pri·
vileges can reside, or a bishop capable of exercising these
dignified prerogatives. Supporing, therefore, all these things
to be true, which, however, we have already refuted, - that, by
the voice of Christ, Peter had been constituted head of the
universal Ohurch3 that the honour vested in him he had
committed to the Roman see3 that this had been established
by the authority of the ancient Church, and confirmed by long
usage 3 that all men, with one consent, had invariably acknowe
ledged the supreme power of the Roman pontiff ; thathe had been
the judge in all causes and of all men, and had been subject to
the judgment of none ; -though they should have all these
concessions, and any more that they wished, yet Ι replyin one
word, that none of them would be of any avail, unless there
be at Rome a Ohurch and a bishop. 'I'hey must of necessity
allow, that Rome cannot be the mother of Churches, unless it
be itself a Church, and that he cannot be the prince of bishops,
who is not a bishop himself. Do they wish, then, to make Rome
the apostolic see? Let them show me atrae and legitimate
apostleship. Do they wish to have the supreme pontifi? Let
them show me a bishop. But where will they show us any
form or appearance of a Churchl They mention it, indeed, and
have it frequently in their mouths. But the Ghurch is known

now speaking of the people, but of the government itself, which
ought always to appear in the Church. Where is the ministry,
such as Christ’s institution requires? Lat us remember what
has already been said of the office of presbytera and bishops.
If we bring the office of cardinals to that rule, we shall confess
that they have no resemblance to presbytera. And Ι should
wish to know what resemblance the pontifi himself bears to a
bishop. The first duty of the episcopal office is to instruct the
people from the word of God, the second duty, closely connect·
