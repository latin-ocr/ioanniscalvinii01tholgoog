to them, Cod calls his own, (y) though they could not have
belonged to him bnt by a special benedictiou. So after he had
deposited his covenant in France, Italy, Germany, Spain, and
England, when those countries were oppressed by the tyranny
of Antichrist, still, in order that the covcnant might remain in·
violable, as a testimony of that covenant, he preserved baptism
among them, which, being consecrated by his lips, retains its
virtue in opposition to all the impiety of men. He also, byhis
providence‚ caused other vestiges of the Church to remain, that
it might not be entirely lost. And as buildings are frequently
demolished in such a manner as to leave the foundations and
ruins remaining, so the Lord has not suffered Antichrist either
to subvert his Cburch from the foundation, or to level it with
the ground3 though, to punish the ingratitudo of men who
despised his word, he has permitted a dreadful concussion and
dilapidation to be made, yet, amidst this devastation, he has
been pleased to preserve the edifice from being entirely destroyed.

XII. While we refuse, therefore, to allow to the Papists the
title of the Church, without any qualification or restriction, we do
not deny that there are Churches among thern. We only con·
tend for the true and legitimate constitution of the Church, which
requires not only a communion in the sacramenta, which are
the signs of a Christian profession, but above all, an agreement
in doctrine. Daniel and Paul had predicted that Antichrist
would sit in the temple of God. (z) The head of that oursed
and abominable kingdom, in the Westem Cburch, we affirm to
be the Pope. When his seat is placed in the temple of God, it
suggests, that his kingdom will be such, that he will not abolish
the name of Christ, or the Church. Hence it appears, that we
by no means deny that Churches may exist, even under his
tyranny; but he has profaned them by sacrilegioua impiety,
afflicted them by cruel despotism, corrupted and almost termi-
nated their existence by false and pernicious doctrines, like poi·
senous potions; in such Chnrches, Christ lies half buried, the
gospel is suppressed, piety exterminated, and the worship of
God almost abolished3 in a word, they are altogether in such a
atate of confusion, that they exhibit a picture of Babylon, rather
than of the holy city of God. 'I'o conclude, I affirm that they
are CburcheS, ineamucb as God has wonderfully preserved
among them aremnant of his people, though miserably dispersed
and dejected, and as there still remain some marks of the Church,
especially those, the efficaoy of which neither the craft of the
devil nor the malice of men can ever destroy. But, on the other
hand, became those marks, which we ought chiefly to regard in
