proaches them for it in the language of Isaiah: “The Most
High dwelleth not in temples made with hands3 as saith the
prophet, Heaven is my throne, and earth is my footstool,” (z)
because God alone sanctifres temples by his word, that they
may be legitimately used for his worship. And if we pre·
sumptuously attempt any thing without his command, the evil
beginning is immediately succeeded by further inventione,
which multiply the mischief without end. Xerxes, however,
acted with great indiscretion, when, at the advice of the magi,
he burned or demolished all the temples of Graece, from an
opinion of the absurdity that gods, to whom all space ought to

be left perfectly free, should be enclosed within walls and
roofs. Asis it were not in the power of God to descend in any

way to us, and yet at the same time not to make any change
of place, or to confine us to earthly means, but rather to use
thern as vehicles to elevate us towards his celestial glory,
which fills all things with its immensity, as well as transcends
the heavens in its sublimity.

Vl. Now, as the present age has witnessed a violent disputa
respecting the efficacy of the ministry, some exaggerating its
dignity beyond measure, and others contending that it is a
criminal transfer to mortal man of what properly belongs to
the Holy Spirit, to suppose that ministers and teachers penetrate
the mind and heart, so as to correct the blindness of the one,
and the hardness of the other, -we must proceed to adecision of
this controversy. The arguments advanced on both sides may
be easily reconciled by a careful observation of the passages, in
which God, the Author of preaching,connecting his Spirit with
it, promises that it shall be followed with success; or those in

which, separating himself from all extemal aids, he attributes .

the commencement of faith, as well as its subsequent progress,
entirely and exclusively to himself. The office of the second
Elias, according to Malachi, was to illuminate the minds and to
“ turn the hearts of the fathers to the children,” and the disobe-
dient to the wisdom of the just. (a) Christ declares that he
sent his disciples, that they “should bring forth fruit ’' (b) from
their labours. What that fruit was, is briefly defined by Peter,
when he says that we are “ born again, not of corruptible seed,
but of incorruptible.” (c) Therefore Paul glories that he had
“begotten'’ the Corinthians “through the gospel,'' and that
they were “the scal of his apostleship ; '¹ (d) and even that he
was “not a minister of the letter,’' merely striking the ear with
avocal sound, but that the energy of the Spirit had been given
to him to render his doctrine efficacious. (e) ln the same sense,
