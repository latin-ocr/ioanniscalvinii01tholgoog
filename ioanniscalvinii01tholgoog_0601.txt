what has the Lord commanded us? Is it not, to take and
divide it among us?(lc) What observance of the command
does Paul inculcate? Is it not the breaking of the bread,
which is the communion of the body of Christ ? (l) When
one man takes it, therefore, without any distribution, what
resemblance does this bear to the command? But it is alleged,
that this one man does it in the name of the whole Church. 1
ask, by what authority? Is not this an open mockery of God,
when one person does separately, by himself, that which ought
not to have been done but among many? 'Phe words of
Christ, and of Paul, are srrfheiently clear to authorize the con·
clusion, that wherever there is uo breaking of the bread for
common distribution among bellavere, there is not the supper
of the Lord, but a false and preposterous imitation of it. But
a false imitation is a corruption ; and the corruption of so great
a mystery cannot take place without impiety. Privato messes,
therefore, are an impious abuse. And as one abuse in religion
soon produces another, after the introduction of this custom of
offering without communicating, they began by degrees to have
innumerable masses in all the corners of the temples, and thus
to divide the people from each other, who ought to have united
in one assembly, to celebrate the mystery of their union. Now,
let the Romanists deny, if they can, that they are guilty of
idolatry in exhibiting bread in their massae, to be worshipped
instead of Christ. ln vain do they boast of those promises of
the presence of Christ ; for however they may be understood,
they certainly were not given in order that impure and profane
men, whenever they please, and for whatever improper use,
may transmntc bread into the body of Christ, but in order
that believers, religiously observing the command of Christ, in
celebrating the supper, may enjoy a true participation of him

IX. ln the purer times of the Church this corruption was
unknown. For, however the more impudeut of our adversa·
ries endeavour to misrepresent this matter, yet it is beyond all
doubt that all antiquity is against them, as we have already
’ evinced in other points, and may be more fully determined by
a diligent perusal of the ancient fathers. But before Iconclude
this subject, 1 will ask our advocates for massas, since they
know that “the Lord hath ” not “ as great delight in sacrifices,
as in obeying the voice of the Lord‚'’and that “to obey is
better than sacrifice, ’' (m) how they can believe this kind of
sacrificing to be acceptable to God, for which they have no
command, and which they do not find to be sanctioned by a
single syllable of the Scriptura. Moreover, since they hear
