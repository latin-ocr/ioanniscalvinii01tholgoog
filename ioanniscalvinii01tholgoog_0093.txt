been long buried in oblivion. For the same Psalmist, in another
place, (a) having confessed one grievous crime, takes occasion
thence to revert to his mother’s womb, where he had eon-
tracted his original pollution; not in order to extenuate his guilt
by the corruption of his nature, but that, accumulating all the
sins of his life, he may find God the more ready to listerr to his
prayers in proportion to the severity of his sels-condemrration.
But though the saints do not always in express terms pray for
remissiones sins, yet if we diligently examine their prayers
recited in the Scriptures, it will easily appear, as I assert, that
they derived their encouragement to pray from the mere urercy
of God, and so always began by deprecating his displeasure;
for if every rnarr examine his own conscience, he isso far from
presuming familiarly to communicate his cares to God, that he
trembles at every approach to him, except in a reliance on his
merny and forgiveness There is also, indeed, another special
confession, when they wish for arr alleviation of punishments,
which is tacitly praying for the pardon of their sins; because it
were absurd to desire the removal of arr effect, while the cause
remains. For we must beware of imitating foolish patients,
who are only solicitous for the cure of the symptomS, but
neglect the radical cause of the disease. Besides, we should
first seek for God to be propitious to us, previously to any
external testimonies of his favour ; because itis his own will
to observe this order, arrd it would be of little advantage to us
to receive benefits from him, unless a discovery to the con·
science of his being appeased towards us rendered him alto·
gether amiable in our view. Of this we are lilrewise apprized
by the reply of Christ3 for when he had determined to heal a
paralytic person, he said, “Thy sins be forgiven thee ; ''(b)
thereby calling our attention to that which ought to be the
chief object of desire, that God may receive us into his favorrr,
and then, by affording us assistance, discover the effect of re·
conciliation. But beside the special confession of present guilt,
in which believers implore the perdon of every sin arrd the
remission of every punishment, that general prefaee, which
conciliatas a favourable attention to our prayers, is never to be
omitted, because, unless they be founded ou God’s free mercy,
they will all be unavailing. 'Po this topic we rnay refer that
passage of John— “ lf we confess our sins, he is faithful and
just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unright·
eousness.'' (c) Wherefore, under the law, prayers are required
to be consecrated by an atonement of blood, to render thern ae·

so great and honourable a privilege, till, purified from their
