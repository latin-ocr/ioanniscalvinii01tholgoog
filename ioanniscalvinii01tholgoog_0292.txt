that a presbyter differs from a bishop in no other respect, than

Now, it is proper to exhibit thc system of ecclesiastical govern-
ment at present maintained by the see of Rome, and all its
dependencies‚ with a full view os that hierarchy which is per-
petually in their mouths, and to compare it with the description
we have given ol the primitive aud ancient Church. This com·
parison will show what kind of a Church there is among those
who fiercely arrogate this exclusive title, in order to oppress, or
rather to overwhalm us. Now, it is best to begin with thc voca·

inquire into their morals, we shall find that there have bean few
or none who would not have been judged unworthy by the
ancient canons. He who has not been a drunkard, hasbeen a
fornicator3 and he who has bean free from both these vices, has ’
been either a gambler or a hunter, or dissolute in some part ofhis
