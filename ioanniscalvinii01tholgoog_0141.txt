This suggests to us our necessity, not only of the grace of the
Spirit within us to sosten, bend, and direct our hearts to ebe·
dience to God, bnt also os his aid to render us invincible, in
opposition to all the stratagems and violent assaults os Satan.
Now, the forms of temptations are many and various. For the
corrupt conceptione of the mind, provoking ns to transgressione

of the laW, whether suggested by our own concupiscence or
excited by the devil, are temptations3 and things not evil in
themselves, nevertheless become temptatione through the sub-
tlety of the devil, when they are obtmded on our eyes in such
amanner that their intervention occasions our seduction or
declension from God. And these temptatione are either from
prosperous, or from adverse events. From prosperans ones, as
nichae, power, honours3 which generally dazzle men's eyes by
their glitter aud extemal appearance of goodness, and inerrare
them with their blandishments, that, caught with such delusione
and intoxicated with such delights‚ they iorget their God. From
unpropitious ones, as poverty, reproaches, contempt, afflictione,
and other things of this kind ; overcome with the bitterness and
difficulty os which, they sall into despondency, cast away seith
and hope, and at length become altogether alienated from Gon
'1¹0 both these kinds os temptatione which assail us, whether
kindled within us by our concupiscence, or presented to us by
the crast ot' Satan, we pray our heavenly Father not ιο permit
us ιο yield, but rather to sustein and raise us up with his hand,
that, strong in his might, we may be able to stand firm against
all the assaults os our malignant enemy, whatever imaginatione
he may inject into our minds; and also, that whatever is pre·
sented to us on either quarter, we may convert it to our benefit3
that is, by not being elated with prosperity or dejected with
adversity. Yet we donet here pray t'or an entire exemption
trem all temptatione, which we very much need, to excite,
stimulate, and animate us, lest we should grew torpid with teo
much rest For it was not without reason that David wished
to be tempted or tried; nor is it without cause that the Lord
daily tries his elect, chastising them by ignominy, poverty, tribu·
lation, and the crosa in various forma But the temptatione of
God are widely differmrt from those of Satan. Satan tempts
te overthrow, condemn, consound, and destroy. But God, that,
by proving his people, hc may make a trial οι their sincerity,
to confirm their strength by exercising it, to mortisy, purisy,
and reline their flesh, which, without such restraints, would
run into the greatest excesses. Resides, Satan attacks persons
unarmed and unprepared, to overwhelm the unwary. “ God,
with the temptation, also malros a way to escape, that they
may be able to bear '’ whatever he brings upon thern. (y) By
