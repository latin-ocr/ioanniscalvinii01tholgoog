as persons are accustomed to yield to an armed enemy, who
they know will immediately take vengeance upon them if
they resist; but because the obedience which is rendered to
princes and magistrates is rendered to God, from whom they
have received their authority. Ι am not speaking ol the
persons,as il the masi< of dignity ought to palliate or excuse
solly, ignorance, or cruelty, and conduct the most nefarious and
fiagitious, and so to acquire for vices the praise due to virtues;
but 1 affirm that the station itsels is worthy of honour and
reverence; so that, whoever our governors are, they ought to
possess our esteem and veneration on account of the office
which they fill.

XXIII. Hence follows another duty, that, with minds dis·
posed to honour and reverence magistrates subjects approve
their obedience to them, in submitting to their edicts, in payIng
taxes, in discharging public duties, and bearing burdens which
relate to the common delence, and in fulfilling all their other
commands. Paul says to the Romans, “Let every soul be
subject unto the higher powers. Whosoever resisteth the power,
resisteth the ordInance of God.'' (m) He writes to Titus, “ Put
thern in mind to be subject to principalities and powers, to obey
magistrates, to be ready to every good work.’' (n) Peter ex·
horts, “ Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the
Lord’s sake ; whether it be to the king, as supreme; or unto
governors, as unto thern that are sent by him for the punish-
ment os evil-doch, and for the praise of them that do well.”(o)
Moreover, that subjects may testisy that theirs is not a hypocrit-
ical but a sincere and cordial submission, Paul teaches, that
they ought to pray to God sor the saiety and prosperity os
those under whose government they live. “I exhort,'' he
says, “ that supplicatione, prayers, intercessions, and giving os
thanks, be made for all men; sor kiugs, and sor all that are in
authority, that we may lead a quiet and peaceable life in all
godliness and honesty.” (p) Here let no man deceive himself.
For as it is impossible to resist the magistrate without, at the
same time, resisting God himself ; though an unarmed magis·
trate may seem to be despised with Impunity, yet God is armed
to inflict exemplary vengeance on the contempt offered to
himself. Under this obedieuce Ialso include the moderation
which private persons ought to proscribe to themselves in rela-
tion to public affairs, that they do not, without being called
upon, intermeddle with affairs ol state, or rashly intrude them·
selves into the office os magistrates, or undertake any thing ot
a public nature. If there be any thing in the public adminis-
