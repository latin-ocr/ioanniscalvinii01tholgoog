support the weakness of our faith3 and we on our part testify
our piety towards him, in his presence and that of angels, as
well as before men. lt may, however, be more brielly defined,
in other words, by calling it a testimony of the grace of God
towards us, confirmed by an outward sign, with a reciprocal
attestation of our piety towards him. Whichever of these defi-
nitions be chosen, it conveys exactly the same meaning as that
of Augustino, which states a sacrament tc be “a visible sign
cf a sacred thing,’' or “ a visible form of invisible grace ; ’' but
it expresses the thing itself with more cleamess and precision;
for as his couciseness leaves some obscurity, by which many
inexperienced persons may be misled,l have endeavoured to
render the subject plainer by more words, that nc room might
be left for any doubt.

11. The reason why the ancient fathers used this word in
such a sense is very evident. Far wheuever the author of the
old common version cf the New Testament wanted to render
the Greek word μυστηριον, mystery, into latin, especially where
it related to Divine things, he used the word sacramentnm,
“ sacrament.'' Thus, in the Epistle to the Ephesians, “ Having
made known unto us the mysteryof his will.” (a) Again:
“ 1t ye have heard of the dispensation of the grace of God
which is given me to you-ward; how that by revelation he
made known unta me the mystery.’' (b) ln the Epistle to the
Colossians: “ 'Phe mystery which hath been hid from ages aud
from generations, but now is made manifest to his saints3 to
whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory
of this mystery.’' (c) Again, to Timothy: “ Great is the mys-
tery of godliness; God was manifest in the flesh.'' (d) lu all
these places, where the word nvystery is used, the author of
that version has rendered it sacrament. He would not say
arcanum, or secret, lest he should appear to degrada the majesty
of the subject. 'Pherefore he has used the word sacrament for
a sacred or Divine secret. ln this signification it frequently
occurs in the writings of the fathers. And it is well known,
that baptism and the Lord's supper, which the latins denomi-
nate sacramarts, are called masteries by the Greeks ς asynony-
mons use of the terms, which removes every doubt. And
hence the word sacrament came to be applied to those signs
which contained a representation of sublime and spiritual
things, which is also remarked by Angustiae, who says, “ It
would be tedicus to dispute respecting the diversity of signs,
which, when they pertain to Diviue things, are called sacra-
uocata’'
