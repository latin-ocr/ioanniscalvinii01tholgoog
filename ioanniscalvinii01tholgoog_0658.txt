eternal law os God, yet had something which distinguished
thern from that precept itself. As the ceremonias, therefore,
might be abrogated without any violation or injury of piety, so
the precepts and duties os love remain of perpetual obligation,
notwithstanding the abolition os all these judicial ordinances
lf this be true, certainly all nations are lest at liberty to enact
such laws as they shall find to be respectively expedient sor
them, provided they be sramcd according to that perpetual rule
of love, so that, though they vary in surm, they may have the
same end. For those barbarous and savage laws which re·
warded theft and permitted promiscuous concubinage, with
others still more vile, execrable, and absurd,l am very sar
t'rom thinking ought to be considered as laws; since they are
not only violations of all righteousness, but outragcs against
humanity itself.

XVI. What Ι have said will be more clearly understood, is
in all laws we properly consider these two things-the consti·
tution os the law and its equity, on the reason of which the
constitution itself is founded and rests. Equity, being natural,
is the same to all mankind; and consequently all lawa on,
every subject, ought to have the same equity sor their end.
Particular enactments and regulations, being connected with
circumstances and partly dependent upon them, may bc differ-
ent in different cases without any impropriety, provided they
are all equally directed to the same object of equity. Now, as
it is certain that the law of God, which we call the moral law,
is no other than a declaration of natural law, and os that
conscience which has been engraven by God on the minds
os men, thewhole rule of this equity, os which we now
speak, is prescribed in it. This equity, therefore, must alone
be the scope, and rule, and end, of all laws. Whatever laws
shall be framed according to that rule, directed to that ob·
ject, and limited to that end, there is no reason why we
should censure them, however they may differ srom the Jewish
law or from each other. The law os God sorbids theft. What
punishment was enacted for thieves, among the Jews, may
be seen in the book of Exodus. (a) The most ancient laws
os other nations punished thest by requiring a compensation
of double the velue. Subsequent laws made a distinction
between open and secret rhet. Some proceedcd to banish·
ment, some to flagellation, and some to the punishment os
death. Falsa witness was punished, among the Jews, with

the same punishment as such testimony would have caused to
be indicted on the person against whom it was given ; (b) in
some countries it was punished with insamy, in others with
hanging, in others with crucifixion. All laws agree in pu·
