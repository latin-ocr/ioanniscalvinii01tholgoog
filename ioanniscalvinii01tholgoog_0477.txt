brought the shadow ten degrees backward in the dial,'' (a) to
promise recovery to Hezehiah. As these things were done to
support and establish the wealrness of their saith, they also were
sacramente.

XIX. But our present design is to treet particularly of those
sacmments which the Lord has appointed to be ordinarily used
in his Church, to keep his worshippers and servants in one
faith and in the confession of the same. “ For,” to nse the lan-
guage of Angustiae, “men cannot be united in any profession
of religion, whether true or false, unless they are connected by
some communion of visible signs or sacraments.’' Our most
merciful Father, therefore, foreseeing this necessity, did, from
the beginning, institute for his servants certain exercises of
piety, which Satan afterwards depraved and corrupted in a
variety of ways, transferring them to impious and idolatrous
worship. Hence those initiatione of the heathen into their
mysteries, and the rest of their degenerata rites, which, though
franght with error aud superstition, at the same time furnish
an evidence that such external signs are indispensable to a pro·
fession of religion. But as they were neither founded on the
word of God, nor referred to that truth which ought to be the
object of all religione emblema they are unworthy of notice,
where mention is made of the sacred symbols which have been
instituted by God, and which have never been perverted from
their original principle, which constitutas them aids of true
piety. Now, they consist not of mere signs, like the rainbow
and the tree of life, but in ceremonies; or, rather, the signs
which are here given are ceremonies. And, as we have before
observed, as they are testimonies of grace and salvation on the
partos the Lord, so on our part they are badges of our profes-
sion, by which we publicly devote ourselves to God, arrd swear
obedience and fidelity to him. Chrysostom, therefore, sorne-
where properly calls them conspecte, by which God covenauts
with us, and we bind ourselves to purity and sanctity of life ς
because a mutual stipulation is made in thern between God arrd
ns For as the Lord promises to obliterate and efface all the guilt
and punishment that we have incurred by sin, and reconciles
us to himself in his only begotten Son, so we, on our parts, by
this profession, bind ourselves to him, to serve him in pietyand
innocence of nse3 so that such sacramente may justly be de-
scribed as ceremonies by which God is pleased to exercise his
people, in the first place, to nourish, excite, and confirm saith
in their hearts5 arrd in the next place, to testify their religion
before men.
