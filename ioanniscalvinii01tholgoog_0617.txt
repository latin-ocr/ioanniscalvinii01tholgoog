sides, even if they could prove themselves to imitate the
apostles in the imposition of hands, in which they have no-
thing similar to the apostles, except this preposterous mimicry,
whence do they derive their oil, which they call the oil os
salvation? Who has taught them to seek salvation in nil?
Who has taught them to attribute to it the property os impart-
ing spiritual strength? ls it Paul, who calls us off from the
elements os this world, and severely condemns an attachment
to such observances?(o) On the contrary, Ι scarlessly pro·
nounce, not of myscll, but from the Lord, that those who
call oil the oil os salvation‚ abjure the salvation which is in
Christ, reject Christ, and have no part in the kingdom of God.
For oil is sor the belly, and the belly for oil; the Lord shall
destroy both, all these weak elements “which perish with the
using,” (p) have no connection with the kingdom os God,
which is spiritual, and shall never perish. What, then, it will
be said, do you apply the same rule to the water with which
we are baptizcd, arrd to the bread arrd wine used in the Lord's
supper? l answer, that in sacraments os Divina appointment,
two things arc to bc regarded— thc substance of thc corporeal
symbol which is proposed to us, and the character impressed
upon it by the word os God, in which consists all its virtue.
Thcrcsore, as the bread, and wine, and water, which are pre-
sented to our view in the sacrarnents, retain their natural sub·
stance, that observation os Paul is always applicablc: “ Meats
sor the belly‚ and the belly sor meats; but God shall destroy
both it and thern ; ” (q) lor they pass and vanish away with the
sashion of this world. But as they arc sanctified by the word
ol God to be sacraments, they do not confine us to the flesh,
but impart to us true arrd spiritual instruction.

VIII. Let us examine still more narrowly how many mon·
stcrs are fostered by this oil. The dispensers os it say, that
the Holy Spirit is given, in baptism sor innocence, in confirma-
tion sorau augmentation os grace; that in baptism we are
regenerated to lise, and that by confirmation we are armed sor
aversare, and they have so sar lost all shame, as to dcny that
baptism can be rightly performed without confirmation. What
corruption! Are wc not, then, “ in baptism buried with Christ,
planted together in the likeness os his death,'' that we may be
“also in the likeness of his resurrection ἓ ” Now this sellow-
ship with the death and lile os Christ, Paul explains to consist in
the mortificationes the flesh, and the vivificationes the Spirit,
“ that our old man is crucified with him, that we should welk
. in newness os lise.'’ (r) What is it to be armed sor the spiritual
