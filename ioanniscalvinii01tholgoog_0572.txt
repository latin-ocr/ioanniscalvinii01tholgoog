by this participation of the body of Christ which we have
mentioned, as fully as they do, who bring him down from
heaven. At the same time, l candidly confess, that 1 reject
that mixture of the fiesh of Christ with our souls, or that trans·
fusion of it into us, which they toach3 because it is sufficient
for us that Christ inspires life into our souls from the substance
of his flesh, and even infusos his own life into us, though his
flesh never actually enters into us. l may also remark, that
the analogy of saith, to which Paul directs us to conform every
interpretation of the Scripture, is in this case, beyond all doubt,
eminently in our favour. Let the adversaries of so clear a
truth examine by what rule of saith they regulare themselves.
“ He that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh,
is not of God.’' (o) Such persons, though they may conceal
it, or may not observo it, do, in effect, deny the reality of his
flesh.

XXXlll. The same judgment is to be formed of our par-
ticipation, which they suppose not to be enjoyed at all, unless
the flesh of Christ be swallowed in the breed. But we do no
small injury to the Holy Spirit, unless we believe that our
communion with the flesh and blood of Christ is the effect of
his incomprehensible influeuce. Even if the virtue of this
mystery, such as we have represented it, and usit was under-
stood by the ancient Church, had received the consideration
justly due to it, for four hundred years past, there would have
been quite enough to satisfy us, and the door would have been
'shut against many pernicious errors, which have kindled dread-
ful dissensione, by which the Church has been miserably agi·
tated in the present, as well as past ages. But sophistical men
insist on ahyperbolical lrind of presence, which is never taught
in the Scripture3 and they contendas eagerly sor this foolish
and absurd imaginaticn, as if the whole of religion consisted in
the enclosure of Christ in the bread. lt priucipally concerns
usto know how the body of Christ, which was once delivered
for us, is made ours, and how we are made partalrers of his
blood which was shed; for the entire possession of Christ
crucilied consists in an enjoyment of all his benelits. Now,
leaving these things, which are of such great importance, and
even neglecting and forgetting them, these sophista take no
pleasure but in this thorny question; how the body of Christ
iscorrcealed under the breed, or under the formos the bread.
They falsely pretend that all that we teach respectinga spi-
ritual participation, is contrary to what they call the true and
real participation 3 because we regard nothing but the manner,
which, in their opinion, is corporeal, as they enclose Christ in
the breed, but in ours is spiritual, because the secret influence
