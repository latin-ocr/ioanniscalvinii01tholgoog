rtishing murder with death, though in several different forms.
The punishments of adulterers in different countries have been
atteudcd with different degrees of severity. Yet we see how,
amidst this diversity, they are all directed to the same end.
For they all agree in denormcing punishment against those
crimes which are condemned by the eternal law of God3 such
as murders, thefts, adulterim, false testimonies, though there is
not a uniformity in the mode of punishment3 and, indeed, this
is neither necessary, nor even expedient. One country, if it
did not inflict the most exemplary vengeance upon murdererS,
would soon be ruined by murders and robberies. One age
requires the severity of punishments to be increased. lf a
country be disturbed by any civil commotion, the evils which
generally arise from it must be corrected by new edicts. ln
time of war all humanity would ba forgotten amidst the din of
arms, if meu were not awed by more than a common dread of
punishment. During famine and pestilenco, unless greater
severity be employed, every thing will fall into ruin. One
tration is more prone than others to some particular vice, unless
it be most rigidly restrained. What maliguity arrd envy against
the public good will be betrayed by him who shall take offeuce
at such diversity, which is best adapted to secure the obser·
vance of the law of God? For the objectiou made by some,
that it is au insult to the law of God given by Moses, when it
is abrogated, and other laws are preferred to it, is without any
foundation3 for neither are other laws preferred to it, when
they are more approved, not on a simple comparison, but on
account of the circumstances of time, place, and nation; nor do
we abrogate that which was never given tous. For the Lord
gave rrot that law by the hand of Moses to be promulgated
among all nations, and to be universally biuding; but after
having taken the Jewish nation into his special charge, pa-
tronage, and protection, he was pleased to become, in a peculiar
manner, their legislator, and, as became a wise legislator, in all
the laws which be gave them, he had a special regard to their
peculiar circumstances.

XVII. It now remains for us, as we proposed, in the last
place, to examine what advantage the common society of
Christians derives from laws, judgnteuts, and magistrates 3 with
which is connected another question- what honour private per·
sons ought to render to magistrates, and how far their obedience
ought to extend. Many persons suppose the office of magis-
tracy to be of no use among Christiana, for that they cannot,
corrsistently with piety, apply for their assistance, because they
are forbidden to have recourse to revenge or litigatiou. But as
Paul, on the contrary, clearly testifies that the magistrate is
“the minister of God to us for good,‘' (c) we understand from

(e) Rom. xiii. ⁴.
