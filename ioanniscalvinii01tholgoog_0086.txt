On these accounts our most merciful Father, though liable to
no sleep or languor, yet frequently appears as if he were sleepy
or languid, in order to exercise us, who are otherwise slothful
and inactive, in approaching, supplicating, end earnestly im·
portuning him to our own advantage. It is extremely absurd,
therefore, in them who, with a view to divert the minds of
men from praying to God‚ pretend that it is useless for us by
our interruptions to weary the Divine Providence, which is
engaged in the conservation of all things; whereas the Lord de·
clares, on the contrary, that he “ is nigh to all that call upon
him in truth.'' (c) And equally nugatory is the objection of
others, that it is superfluous to petition for those things which
the Lord is ready voluntarily to bestow; whereas even those
very things, which flow to us from his spontaneous liberality,
he wishes us to consider as granted to our prayers. This is
evinced by that memorable passage in the Psalms, as wellas
by many other correspondent texta, - “ The eyes of the Lord
are upon the righteous‚ and his ears are open unto their
cry; '² (d) which celebrates the Divine Providence as sponta-
'noonsly engaged to accomplish the salvation of believers ; yet
does not omit the exercise of saith, by which sloth is expelled
from the minds ol' men. The eyes of God‚ then, are vigilant
to saccom the necessity of the blind; but he is likewise will·

towards ns. And thus it is equally true, that “he that keep-
eth Israel neither slumbers nor sleeps,’' and yet that he remains,
as it were, forgetful of us, while he beholds us slothful and
dumb.

IV. Now, for conducting prayer in a right and proper man·
ner, the first mle is, that our heart and mind be composed toa
suitable frame, becoming those who enter into conversation
with God. This state of mind we shall certainly attain, if,
divested of all carnal cares and thoughts, that tend to divert
and sednce it from a right and clear view of God‚ it not only
devotas itself entirely to the solemn exercise, but is likewise as
far as possible elevated aud carried above itself. Nor do Ι here
require amiud so disengaged as to be disturbed by no solicitude ;
since there ought, on the contrary, most anxiously to be kindled
within us a fervency of prayer, (as we see the holy servants of
God discover great solicitude, and even anguish, when they

say they utter their complaints to the Lord from the deep
abysses of affliction and the very jaws of death.) But 1 main·

by which the wandering mind may· be hurried hither and
thither, and dragged from heaven down to earth. It ought to
