Now, it would be extremely unreeeoneble that the body os Paul,
in which he “bore the morke of the Lord Jesus,”(g) and in
which he eminently glorified Christ, should be deprived of the
reward of the crown. Hence also that exultation: “We look
for the Savionr [rom heaven, who shell change our vile body,
thet it may be foshioned like unto hisglorioue body.’' (t) And
if it be true, “that we must through much tribulatiou enter
into the kingdom of God,'' (i) there can be no reason ior pro-
hibitiug this entrance to tha bodies, which God treius under the
banner of the cross, eud honours with the glory of victory.
rI'herefore no doubt hes ever been entertained by the saints, Α
whether they should hope to be compenione of Christ here·
aster; who transfers to his own person all the afflictione with
which we ere tried, to teech us that they are conducting usto life.
And God also established the holy fathers under the lew ιιι this
saith by en external ceremony. For to what purpose was the
rite os sepulture, es we heve already seen, but to instruct them
that another lise was prepared sor the interred bodiesl 'Phe
same wes suggested by the spicea arrd other symbols οι immor·
mlity, which, like the sacrifices under the law, assisted the
obscurity oi direct instruction. Nor did this custom ariee from
superstition; for we find the Holy spirit es diligent ιιι mention-
ing the sepulturas, ee in insisting on the principal mysteries os
saith. And Christ commende thisasno mesu offise;(lc) certainly
for no other reason, but because it reieer our eyes from the view
oi the greve, which corrupte and dissolves all things, to the epec-
tacle of future renovation. Besides the very careful observance
of this ceremony, which is commended in the fathers, suffi-
ciently provee it to heve been an excellent and valuable es·
elstance to saith. Nor would Abraham heve discovered such
solicitous concern about the sepulchre os his wife, is he had not
been ectusted by motives of religion, and the prospect os more
than worldly sdvonng03 that by adorning her dead body with
the emblems oi the resurrection, he might confirm his own seith,
end thet of his family. (l) There is yet a clamer proof os this
iu the example oi Jacob; who, to testify to his posterity that
the hope οι the promised land did not forsalre his heart even in
death, commende his honesto be reconveyed thither. (m) lt he
was to be fumiehed with e new body, would not this have been
a ridiculous command concerniug dust thet was soon to be an·
nihileted? Whereforc, is the authority os the Scripture hee
