person of Christ the two natures are united in such a manner,
that each retains its peculiar properties undiminished. That
Eutyches was justly condemned as a heretic, our adversaries
will not deny; it is surprising that they overlook the cause of
his condemnation, which was, that by taking away the differ·
ence between the two naturas, and insisting on the unity of the
person, he made the Divinity human, and deified the humanity.
What absurdity, therefore, is it to mingle heaven and earth
together, rather than not to draw the body down from the
celestial sanctuary l They endeavour to justify themselves by
adducing these texts: “No man hath ascended up to hea-
ven, but he that came down from heaven, even the Son of
man, which is in heaven ; ²’ and, “The only begotten Son,
which is in the bosom of the Father, he hath declared him.”(s)
But it argues the same stupidity to disregard the communica·
tion of properties, a term which was with good reason adopted
by the holy fathers in the early ages. When Paul says that
“The Lord of glory ’² was “crucified,’' (t) he certainly does
not intend that Christ suffered any thing in his Divinity,
but that the same person, who suffered as an abject and de·
spised man, was also, as God, the Lord of glory. ln the same
sense, the Son of man was in heaven3 because the same Christ,
who, according to the flesh, dwelt on earth as the Son os
man, as God, was always in heaven. For this reason, in the
same passage, he represents himself as having descended from
heaven, according to his Divinity3 not that his Divinity quitted
heaven to confine itself in the prison of the body; but because,
though it filled all space, yet it dwelt corporeally, or naturally,
and in a certain ineffable manner, in the humanity. lt is a dis·
tinction common in the schools, and which I am not ashamed
to repeat, that though Christ is every where entire, yet all that
is in him is not every where. And l sincerely wish that the
schoolmen themselves had duly considered the meaning of
this observation3 for then wa should never have heard of
their stupid notion of the corporeal presence of Christ in the
sacrament. Therefore, our Mediator, as he is every where en-
tire, is always near to his people; and in the sacred supper
exhibits himself present in a peculiar manner, yet not with
all that belongs to him ; because, as we have stated, his body
has been received into heaven, and remains there till he shall
corne to judgment.

XXXI. They are exceedingly deceived, who cannot con·
ceive of any presence of the flesh of Christ in the supper, ex·
cept it be attached to the bread. For on this principle they
leave nothing to the secret operation of the Spirit, which unites
