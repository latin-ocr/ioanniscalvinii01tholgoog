te prevent the intmsion of any error which may corrupt or
obscure this pure use of ecclesiastical regulations. This end
will be secured, if all the forms, whatever they may be, carry
the appearance of manifest utility, if very few are admitted,
and principally is they are accompanied with the instructions
os a faithful pastor, to shut the door against all corrupt opinions.
'l'he consequence os this knowledge is, that every person will re·
tain his liberty in all these things, and yet will voluntarily impose
some restraint upon his liberty, sofar as the decorum we have
mentioned, or the dictatos of charity, shall require. In the
next place, it will be necessary, that, without any superstition,
we should attend to the observance of these things ourselves,
and not too rigidly exact it frorn others, that we should not
esteem the worship of God to be improved by the multitude
of ceremonies; and that one Ohurch should not despise an·
other on account os a variety of extemal discipline. Lastly‚
establishing no perpetual law os this kind lor ourselves, we
ought to refer the nse and end of all such observanoes to
the edification os the Ghurch, according to the exigence of
which we should be content not only with the change os some
particular observance, but with the abolition of any that have
hitherto been in use among us. For that the abrogation os
some ceremonias, not otherwise inconsistent with piety or
decorum, may become expedient from the circumstances of
particular periods, the present age exhibita an actual proof.
For such hes been the blindness and ignorance of former times,
(lhurches have heretofore adhered to ceremonies with such
corrupt sentimenta and such obstinate acal, that it is scarcely
possible sor them to be sufficiently purified from monstrous
superstitious without the abolitiones many ceremonies, sor the
original institution of which, perhaps, there was some cause,
and which are not in themselves remarkable for any impiety.
