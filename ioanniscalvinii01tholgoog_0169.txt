formed to the image 11 his Son. The grem and secret coun-
sel has been revealed. 'l'he Lord knows who 111 his, but
what was known to God is manifested 11 men. Nor does he
favour any othcrs with the participation of so great a mystery,
but those particular individuale whom he foreknew, and pre·
destinated 11 be his own.'’ A little after he concludes, “ The
mercy of God is from everlasting to everlasting upon them that
fear him3 from everlasting in predestination, to everlasting in
beatification3 the one knowing no beginning3 the other, no
end.’' But what necessity is there 111 citing the testimony of
Bemard, since we hear from the Master’s own mouth, that “ no
man heth seen the Father, save 111 which is of God,’' (a) which
implies, that all who are not regenerated by God, are stupe·
fied with the splendour of his countenance. Faith, indeed, is
properly connected with electiori, provided it occupies the 11-
cond place. This order is clearly expressed in these words
of Christ: “This 11 the Father’s will, that of all which he bath
given me, l should lose nothing. And this is the will of him
that sent me, that every one which believeth on the Son, may
have everlesting life.’' (o) Ι1 he willed the salvation of all, he
would give them all into the custody of his Son, and unite thern
all to his body by the sacred bond 11 111111. Ν111, 11 isevident,
that faith is the peculiar pledge of his paternal love, reserved for
1111 adopted children. 'I'herefore Christ says in another place,
“ 'Phe sheep follow the shepherd, for they know his voice ; and
a stranger will they not follow, for they know not the voice of
strangers.” (p) Whence arises this difference, but because their
ears are divincly penetrated? For no man makes himselfa
sheep, but is created such by heavenly grace. Hence 1111 the
Lord proves the perpetual certainty and security of our salvation,
11111111 11 11 kept by the invincible power of God (q) 'Phere-
fore he concludes that unbelievers are not 1111 sheep, because
they are not of the number 11 those whom God by 1111111
promised 11 him for bis future disciples. (r) Moreover, the testi-
monies l have cited, being expressive of perseverance, are 11
many declaratione of the invariable perpetuity of election.

Xl. Now, with respect to the reprobate, whom the apostle
introduces in thesemo place3 as Jacob, without any merit yet
acquired by good works, is made an object· of grace, so Esau,
while yet nnpolluted by any crime, is accounted an object of
hatred. (s) If we turn our attention to works, we insuit the
apostle, as though he saw not that which is clear to us. Now,
that he saw none, is evident, because he expressly asserts the one
to have been elected end the other rejected while they had not
