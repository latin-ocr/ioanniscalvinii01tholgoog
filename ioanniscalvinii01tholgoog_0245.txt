and those things which in the Holy Scripturas ere commanded to
be done with great moderatiori, and without violating the sinceri·
ty of love, or breaking the unity of peace, fer the correction of
the faults of our brethrsn, they pervert to the sacrilege of schism,
end an occasion of separation from the Ohurch.'’ To picus and
peaceable persons he gives this advice: thet they should correct
in mercy whatever they can ; that what they cannot, they should
patiently bear, and affectionately lament, till God either reform
end correct it, or, at the harvest, root up the tares and sift out
the chaff. All picus persons should study to fortify themselves
with these couusels‚ lest, while they consider themselves as
valiant and strenuous desenders of righteousness, they depart
from the kingdom of heaven, which is the only kingdom of
righteousness. For since it is the will of God that the com·
muniones his Ohurch should be maintained in this extcmal
society, those who, from an aversion to wiched men, destroy
the token of that society, enter on a course iu which they are
lehttlttttlfftlht hullthtugltl fruti nli
ure many who escape their observation, who, nevertheless, are
truly holy and innocent in the sight of God. Secondly, let
them consider, that os those who appear subject to moral mala·
dies, there are many who by no means please or datter them·
salves in their vices, but are ostentimes aroused, with a serious
fear of God, to espire to greater integrity. Thirdly, let them

consider that judgment ought not to be pronounced upon a ruan ,

from a single act, since the holiest persons have sometimes most
grievous falls. Fourthly, let them consider, that the ministry
of the word, and the participation of the sacramenta, bave
too much influence in preserving the unity of the Church,
to admit of its being destroyed by the guilt of afew impious
men. Lnstly‚ let them consider, that in forming an estimare
of the Ghurch‚ the judgmentof God is of more weight than
that of man.

XVII. When they allege that there must be some reason
why the Ohurch is said to be hely, it is necessary to examine
the holiness in which it excels, lest by refusing to admit the
existence of a Church without absolute and sinless perfectiori,
we should leave no Church in the world. lt is true, that, as
Paul tells us, “ Christ loved the Church, and gave himself for
it, that he might sanctify and cleanse it, by the washing of water
by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious

Church‚ not having spot, or wrinkle, or any such thing.'' (d) lt
is nevertheless equally true, that the Lord works from day to
day in smoothing its wrinkles, and purging away its spots;
