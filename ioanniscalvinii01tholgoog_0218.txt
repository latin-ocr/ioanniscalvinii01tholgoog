that which had been offered as au atoning sacrifice. We must,
therefore, maintain the connection stated by the apostle —that
we shall rise, because Christ has risen ; (y) 101 nothing is 111010
improbable, than that 0111 body, in which “ we bear about the
dying of tha Lord Jesus,'’ (z) should¹ be deprived of a resurrec-
tion similar to his. There was an illustrious example 01 this
immediately on Christ’s resurrection, when “the graves were
opened, and many bodies 01 1110 saints which slept arose.” (a)
l'or it cannot bo denicd, that this was a prelude, or rather an
earnest, of the final resurrection, which we expect3 such aa
was exhibitad before in Enoch and Elias, whom Tertullian
speaks of as “ the candidates 01 the resurrection,” because they
were taken into the immediate care 01 God, with an entire ex·
em tion from corruption in body and soul. ’
illl. 1 am ashamed of consuming 00 many words on so
clear a subject 3 but my readers will cheerfnlly unite with me in
submitting to this trouble, that no room may be 1011 101 men of
perverse and presumptuous minds 10 deceive the unwary. The
unsteady spirits 1 am now opposing, bring forward a figment 01
111011 own brains, that at the resurrection there will be acreation
of new bodies. What reason can induce thern to adopt this
sentiment, but a seeming incredibility, in their apprehension,
that a body long consumed by corruption can ever return to its
pristine state? Unbelief, therefore, is the only source 01 this
opinion. In the Scriptura, cn the contrary, we are uniformly
exhorted by the Spirit of God 10 hope for the resurrection of
our body. Por this reason, baptism is spoken of by Paul as a
0001 01 our future resurrection; (b) and we are as clearly invited
10 11110 confidence by the sacred Supper, when we receive into
our mouths the symbols 01 spiritual grace. And certainly 1110
exhortation 01 Paul, to “yield our members as instrumenta
01 righteousness unto God,'' (c) would lose all 110 force, if
unaccompanied by what he afterwards subjoins: “ He that
raised up Christ from 1110 dead, shall also quicken your mortal
bodies.” (d) For what would it avail to devote our feet, hands,
eyes, and tongues 101110 service 01 God, if they were 1101 10
participate the benefit and reward? 'l'his is clearly confirmed
by the following passage 01 Paul: “ The body is not 101 101-
nication, but for the Lord; and the Lord for the body. And
God hath both raised up the Lord, arrd will also raise up us by
his own power.” (e) The following passages are still plainer—
that our bodies are the “ temples of the Holy Ghostss’ and
“ members 01 Christ.’⁷ (s ) ln the mean time, we see how he
connects the resurrection with chastity and holiness3 arrd 00
