the elements are consecrated, to be a lively preaching, which
edifies the hearers, which penetrates their minds, which is
deeply impressed upon their hearts, which exerts its efficacy
in the accomplishment of that which it promises. These con·
siderations clearly show that tlre reservation of the sacrament,
insisted upon by many persons, for the purpose of extraordinary
distribution to the siclt, is perfeotly useless. For either they
will receive it without any recital of the institution of Christ, or
the minister will accompany the sign witha true explication os
the mystery. lf nothing be said, it isan abusa and corruption.
If the promises are repeated and the mystery declared, that those
who are about to receive it may communicate with advantage,
we have no reason to doubt that this is tlre true consecration.
What end will be answered, then, by the former consecrarius,
which, having been pronounced when the siclt persons were
not present, is of no avail ιο them? But it will be alleged,
that those who adopt this practice have the example of the
ancient Church in their favour. This I confess; but ina
matter of such grean importunes, and in which any error must
be highlysdangerous, there is nothing so safe as to follow the
truth itsel.

to tha sincere worshippersof God, who, in the participation of it,
experience Christ to be their life, whom it stimulates to thanks·
giving, whom it exhorts to mutual charity among themselves;
so, on the contrary, it is changed into a most noxious poison ιο
all whose faith it does not nonrish and confirm, and whom it
does not excite to thanksgiving and charity. Foras corporeal
food, when it offenda a diseased stomach, becoming itself cor·
rupted, is found rather noxious than nutritious, so this spiritual
food, when it meets with a soul polluted by iniquity, only pre·
cipitates it into a more dreadful tuin, not, indeed, from any
fault in the food, but because “ unto them that are defiled and
unbelieving nothing is pure,’' (l) however it may be otherwise
sanctified by the blessing of the Lord. For, as Paul says, “ He
that cateth and drinketh unworthily is guilty of the body and
blond of the Lord, and cateth and drinketh judgment ιο himself,
not discerning the Lord’s body.” (m) Persons of this descrip-
tion, who, without one particle of faith, or the least feeling of
charity, intrude themselves, like so many swina, to seize the

it with the utmost dishonour they are capable of casting upon
it, robbing it of its dignity, and receiving it in such a manner
