what could have been said more disgraceful than the following
language? “The lrings of the Gentiles exercise dominion
over them3 but it shall not be so among you.” (a) Nor hashe
prescribed a severer law to his servants than he first imposed
upon himself. ‘⁸ Man,’' says he, “who made me a judge ora
dividet over you l ’² (y) We see he plainly refuses to act the
part of a judge, which he would not have done, had it beerra
thing consistent with his office. Will not his servants allow
themselves to be reduced to that rank, to which their Lord
voluntarily submitted himself? With respect to the second
point,l wish they could as easily prove it by experience as
make the assertion. But since the apostles thought it not
right for them “to leave the word of God, and serve tables,” (z)
this must confound those who are reluctant to admit, that it is
not in the power of the same man to be at the same time agood
bishop and a good prince. For if they, who by the extent of the
gifts with which they were endued, were enabled to sustain sar
more numerous and weighty cares than any men who have lived
since their time, after all confessed themselves incapable of
attending to the word of God and the service of tables without
fainting under the burden, how should it be possible for these
men, who are by no means to be compared to the apostles‚ so
vastly to surpass them in industryi 'Phe very attempt hae
betrayed the most consummate effrontery and presumptuous
confidence. Yet we see it hasbeen done; with what success,
is obvious ; the unavoidable consequence has been the desertion
of their own fonctions, and intrusion into those which belonged
to others.

X. lt has, without doubt, been from small beginnings, that
they have gradually risen to such entinence. For it was not pos·
sible for them to malre so great an advance at oue step. But
sometimes by fraudulent and secret artifices, they exalted them·
selvas in aclandestine manner, so that no one perceived the en-
croachment till it had been effected: sometimes, when opportu-
nity offered, by terrifying and menacing princes, they extorted
from them some augmentation of their, power ; sometimes, when
they saw princes inclined to favour them, they abused their fool·
ish and inconsiderate pliability. ln early times,'if any contro·
versy arose, the believers, in order to avoid the necessity of liti·
gation, used to refer it to the decision of their bishop, of whose
integrity they were fully satisfied. The ancient bishops were
frequently embarrassed with such arbitrations, which exceed·
ingly displeased them, as Augustino somewhere declares; bnt
to save the parties from lawsuits, they reluctantly undertoolr this
troublesome business. From voluntary arbitratione, which were
