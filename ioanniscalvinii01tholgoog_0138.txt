uscos it. Since tho pride os mau does not easily suffer itselt'
to be convinced of this, the Lord declares that he has given to
all ages an eminent proof of it, by seeding his people with
manna in the desert, in order to apprize us “ that man doth not
live by bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out os
his mouth; ’' (r) which implies, that it is his power alone by
which our life and strength are sustained‚ although he commu·
nicates it to us by corporeal means; as he is accustomed to
teach us likewise by an opposite example, when he breaks, at
his pleasure, the strength (and, as he himself calls it, “ the
staff”)of bread,so that though men eat they pine with hunger,
and though they drink ara parched with thirst. (s) Now, they
who are not satisfied with daily bread, but whose avidity is
insatiable‚ and whose desires 880 unbounded, and they who are
satiated with their abundance, and think themselves secure
amid their immense riches, and who nevertheless supplicate the
Divine Being in this petition, are guilty of moching him. For
the former ask what they would not wish to obtain, and even
what most of all they abominata that is, daily bread only;
they conceal from God, as much as they can, their avaricious
disposition ; whereas true prayer ought to pour out before him
the whole mind, and all the inmost secrets os the soul; and the
latter implore what they are sar from expectiug to receive from
him, what they think they have in their own possession. In
its being called “curs” the Divine goodncss is, as we have
observed, the more conspicuous, since it makes that curs, to
which we have no claim of right. Yet we must not reject the
explanation which l have likewisc hinted at, that it intends
also such as is acquired by just and innocent labour‚ and not
procured by acts os deception and rapine ; because, whatever
we acquire by any criminal methods, is never our own, but
belongs to othere. Our praying that it may be ‘¹ given ⁷² to us
signitics that it is the simple 8ηά gratuitous donation 01 God,
from what quarter soever we receive it; even when it most os
811 appears to be obtained by our own skill 8ηά industry, and to
be procured by our own hands3 since it is solely the effect of
his blessing, that our labours are attended with success.
