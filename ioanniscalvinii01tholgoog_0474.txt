and retains its nature, however men may vary3 but as it is
one thing to offer, and another to receive, there is no incon-
gruity in maintaining, that a symbol, consecrated by the word
of the Lord, is in reality what it is declared to be, and preserves
its virtue, and yet that it confers no benefit on awiclred and
impious person. But Augustino happily solves this question
in a few words: he says, “ lf thou receive it carnally, still it
ceases not to be spiritual; but it is not so to thee.’' And, as
in the passages already cited, this father shows that the symbol
used in a sacrament is of no value, if it be separated from the
truth signified by it, so, on the other band, he states that it is
necessary to distinguish them, even where they are united, lest
our attention be confined too much to the external sign, ‘¹ Aa
to follow the letter,'' says he, “and to take the signs instead of
the things signified, betrays servile weakness, so it is the part of
unsteadiness and error to interpret the signs in such a man·
ner as to derive no advantage from them.” He mentions two
faults, against which it is necessary to guard, One is, when
we take tlte signs as if they were given in vain, and disparaging
or diminishing their secret significations by our perverse mis·
construction, exclude ourselves from the advantage which we
ought to darive from them. 'Phe other is, when, not elevating
our minds beyond the visible sign, we transferte the sacramenta
the praise of those benefits, which are only conferred upon us
by Christ alone, and that by the agency of the Holy Spirit,
who makes us partalrers of Christ himself, by the instrumen-
tality of the external signs which invite us to Christ, but
which cannot be perverted to any other use, without a shams-
ful subversion of all their utility.

XVII. Wherefore let us 'abide by this conclusion, that the
office of the sacramente is precisely the sameas that of the
word of God; which is to offer and present Christ to us, and
in him the treasures of his heavenly grace; but they confer
no advantage or profit without being received by faith; just as
wine, or oil, or any other liquor, though it bc poured plentifully
on a vessel, yet will it overflow and be lost, unless the mouth of
the vessel be open; and the vessel itself, though wet on the
outside, will remain dry and empty within. lt is also neces·
sary to guard against being drawn into an error allied to this,
from reading the extravagant langnage used by the fathers with
a view to exalt the dignity of the sacraments; lest we should
suppose there is some secret power annexed and attached to
the sacramente, so that they communicate the grace of the
Holy Spirit, just as wine is given in the cup; whereas the
only office assigned to them by God, is to testify and eonfinn
his benevolence towards us, nor do they impert any benefit,
unless they are accompanied by the Holy Spirit to open our
