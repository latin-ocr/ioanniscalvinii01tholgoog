wearied with praying, they seemed to beat the air, and God
seemed deas to their petitions, yet did not desist from praying3
because the authority of the Divina word is not maintained,
unless it be fully credited, notwithstanding the appearance 01
any circumstances to the contrary. Nor let us tempt God, and
provoke him against us by wearying him with our presump-
tion, which is the practice 01 many who merely bargain with
God on a certain condition, and as though 116 were subservierit
to their passions, bind him with laws 01 their own stipulation3
with which unless he immediately complica, they give way to
anger and fretfulness, to cavils, and murmurs, and ragc. 'I'o
such persons, therefore, 116 frequently grants in his wrath what
he denies in mercy to others. This is exemplified in the
children of lsrael, for whom it had been better for the Lord not
to have heard them, than for them to swallow his indignation
with the meat that he sent them. (d) ⁴
LII. But if, aster long waiting, our sense neither understands
what advance we have made by praying, nor experieuces any
advantage resulting from it, yet our faith will assure us, what
cannot be perceivcd by sense, that we have obtained what was
expedient for us, since the Lord so frequently aud so certainly >
promises to take care of our troubles when they have been once
deposited in his bosom. And thus he will cause us to pos·
sess abundance in poverty, and consolation in affiiction. For
though all things fail us, yet God will never forsake us, he
cannot disappoint the cxpectatiou and patience of his people.
He will amply compensate us for the loss of all others, sor he
comprehende in himself all blessings, which he will revcal to us
at the day of judgment, when his kingdom will be fully mani-
fested. Besides, though God grants our prayers, he does not
always answer them according to the express form of the
request; but seeming to keep us in suspense, shows by un·
known means that our prayers were not in vain. This is the
meaning 01 these words 01 John : “ 11 we know that he heareth
us, whatsoever we ask, we know that we have the petitione ⁶
that we desired 01 him.'‘ (e) This seems to be a feeble super·
fluity 01 expression, but is in reality a very uselul declaration,
that God, even when he does not comply with our desires, is
neverthelcss favourable and propitious to our prayers, so that a
hope depending upon his word can never disappoint us. Now,
this patience is very necessary to support believcrs, who would ,
not long stand unless they relied upon it. For the Lord
proves his people with heavy trials, and exercises them with
severity 3 frequently driving them to various kinds of extremi·
ties, and suffering them to remain in them a long time before 116
