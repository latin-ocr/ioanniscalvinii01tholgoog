tion, they never used to dissolve a provincial couucil without ap-
pointing a time and place 101 1110 00111. For, to sammon a uni·
versal council, was the exclusive prerogative 01 the emperor, as
all the ancient records testisy. As long as this severity conti-
nued, the clergy required nothing 0101011001 1110 people than
they exemplified in their own conduct. Indeed, they were 101
01010 severe to themselves than to the laity3 and it is reasonable
that the people should be ruled with a milder and less rigid dis-
010110ος and that the clergy should inflict heavier censuros, and
exercise sar less indulgence to themselves than to other persons.
How all this has become obsolete‚ it is unnecessary to relate,
when nothing can be imagined more licentious and dissolute
than this order 01 men in the present day; and their profligacy
has gone to such a length, that the whole world is exclaiming
against them. 'I'hat all antiquity may not appear to have been
entirely forgotteu by them, I consess, they deceive the eyes 01 1110
simple with certain shadows, but these bear no more resemblance
to the ancient usages, than the mimicry 01 an ape to the rational
and considerate conduct 01 men. 'I'here is a remarkable passage
in Xenophon, where he states how shamesully the Persians had
degenerated 11010 1110 virtues 01 their ancestors, and, 11010 an
austere course 01 1110, had sunlr into delicacy and effeminacy,
but that, to conceal their shame, they sedulously observed the
ancient forms. For whereas, in the tirne 01 Cyrus, sobriety and
temperance were carried so 101, that it was unnecessary, aud was
even considered as a disgrace 101 any one to blow his nose, their
posterity continued scrupulously to resraiu srom this act; but to
absorb the 1000110, and retain the setid humours produced by their
gluttony, even till theyalmost putrefied, was held quite allowable.
So, according to the ancient rule, it was unlawsul to bring cups
to the table; but they had no objection to drinlr wine till they
were obliged to be carried away drunk. lt had been an estab-
lished custom to eat only one meal a day; these good successors
had not abolished this custom, but they had continued their
banquets from 0000 10 midnight. Because their ancient law en·
joined men to finish their day's journey sasting‚ it continued to
be a permanent custom among thern 3 but they were at liberty,
and it was the general practice, 101 1110 salre 01 avoiding satigue, to
contract the journey to two horus. Whenever the Papists bring
sorward their degenerate rules, sor the purpose 01 showing their

. resemblance to the holy fathers, this example will sufficiently

expose their ridiculous imitation, 01 which no painter could draw
amore striking likeness.

XXIII. 10 000 instance, they are too rigorous and inflexible,
that is, in not permitting priests to marry. With what impunity
fornication rages among thern, it is unnecessary to remark;
imboldened by their polluted celibacy‚ they have become hard·
