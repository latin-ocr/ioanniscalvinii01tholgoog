oouncil is brought forwerd, 1 would wish, first, theta diligent
inquiry should be made, at what time, for what cause, and with
what design it was held, and what kind of persons were present ;
secondly, that the subject discussed in it should be examined by
the standard of the Scripture3 and this in such amanner that
the determination should have its weight, and be considered as
a precedent or ease formerly decided, but that it should not pre-
clude the exarnination which 1 have mentioned. lsincerely
wish that every person would observa the method recommended
by Augustine in his third book against Maximinus. For, with
a view to silence the contentione of that heretic respecting the
decrees of couucils, he says, “ l ought not to object to you the
Oouucil of Nice, nor ought you to object to rue the Oouncil of
Ariminum, to preclude each other’s judgment by a previous de·

cision. 1 arn not bound by the authority of the latter, nor you -

by that of the former. Let cause contend with cause, and argu·
ment with argument, on the ground of scriptural authorities,
which exclusively belong to neither party, but are common to
hoth.’' The consequenceof such a mode of proceediug would
be, that couucils would retain all the majesty which is due
to them, while at the same, time the Scriptura would hold the
preeminence, so that every thing would be subject to its stand·
ard. Upon this principle, those ancient oouncils, such as the
Oouncil ol' Nice, of Constantinople, the first of Ephesus, that ot'
Chalcedon, and others like them, which were held sor the con·
demnation of errore, we cheerfully receive aud reverence aa
sacred, as far as respecta the articles of saith which they have
defended, for they coutain nothing but the pure and natural
interpretation of the Scriptura, which tha holy fathers, with
stultiut?{agillimi} ltull‘ttlltuzu
oouncils, lilrewiee, we discover a true zeal for piety, and evidengt
proofsof sense, learning, and prudence. But aethe progress of the
world is generally frorn worse to worse, it is easy to see, from the
more recent couucils, how much the Church has gradually de-
generated from the purity of that golden age. Even in these
more corrupt ages, ldoubt not, the couucils have been partly corn-
posedof some bishops of a better character3 but the same obser·
vation may be applied to their acts, which was formerly made
in a way of complaint against the decreesof the Roman senate,
by the senators themselves. Where opinions prevail according
to their number, and not according to the weight of argument by
which they are supported, the better part of the assembly must
of necessity be frequently orercome by the majority. And
couucils have certainly iseued many impioue decrees. It is
uuuecessary bere to produce particular examples, aa well be
eattae thie would carryue to too great aleugth, aebemusa it lta!
