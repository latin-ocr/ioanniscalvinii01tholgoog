ness, since no other righteousuess is admitted into heaven but
au entire observance of the law. Nor is there any more solidity
in ‘their pretence of a sufficient compensation for imperfectione
by works of supererogation. For are they not by this perpe-
tually recurring to the subterfuge, from which they have already
been driven, that the partial observance of the law constitutes,
as far as it goes, a righteousncss of works? They unblush·
ingly assume as granted, what no man of sound judgment will
concede. The Lord frequently declares, that he acknowlcdges
no righteousness of works, except in a perfect obedience to his
law. What presumption is it for us, who are destitute of this,
in order that we may not appear to be despoiled of all our
glory, or, iu other words, to submit entirely to the Lord-what
presumption is it for us to boast of Ι know not what fragments
of afew actions, and to endeavour to supply deficiencies by
other satisfactions! satisfactione have already been so corn·
plately demolished, that they ought not to occupy even a
transient thought. I only remark, that those who trifle in this
manner, do not consider what an execrable thingsin is in the sight
of God3 for indeed they ought to know, that all the righteous-
ness of all mankind, accunrulated in one mass, is insufficient to
compensate for asingle sin. We see that man on account of
one offence was rejected and abandoned by God, so that he
lost all means of regaining salvation. (r) 'l'heyare deprived,
therefore, of the power of satisfaction, with which, however
they flatter themselves, they will certainly never be able to
render a satisfaction to God, to whom nothing will be plcasing
or acceptable that proceeds from his enemies. Now, his ene-
rnies are all those to whom he determines to imputa sin. Our
sins, therefore, must be covered and forgiven, before the Lord
can regard any of our works. Whence it follows that the
remission of sins is absolutely gratuitous, and that it is wick-
edly blasphemed by those who obtrude any satisfactione. Let
us, therefore, after the example of the apostle, “ forgetting those
things which are behind, and reaching forth unto those things
which are before, press toward the mark for the price of our
high calling.’' (s)

XIV. But how is the pretence of works of supererogation
consistent with this injunction-“ When yc shall have done
all those things which are commanded you, say, We are un-
profitable servants3 we have done that which was our duty to
do? ’' (t) This direction does not inculcata an act of simula-
tion or falsehood, but a decision in our mind respecting that
of which we are certain. 'Phe Lord, therefore, commands us
sincerely to think and consider with ourselves, that our services
