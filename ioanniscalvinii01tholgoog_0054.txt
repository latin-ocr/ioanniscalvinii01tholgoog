fication independent of workS, so James will not allow those to
be accounted righteous, who are destitute 01 good works. 'Phe
consideration 01 this object will extricata us from every diffi-
culty. For the principal mistalre of our adversaries consists in
supposing‚ that James describes the methodos justification,

while he only endeavours to destroy the corrupt security of ἲ

those who make vain pretences to faith, in order to excuse their
contempt of good works. Into whatever 1011111, therefore, they
pervert the words of James, they will extort nothing but these
two truths — thata vain notion of saith cannot justify; and that
the faithful, not content with such an imagination, manifest
their righteousness by their good works.

XIII. Nor can they derive the least support from a similar
passage which they cite from Paul, that “Not the hearers of the
law, bnt the doers of the law, shall be justified.” (p) Ι baveno
wish to evade it by the explanation of Ambrose, that this is
spoken, because faith in Christ is the fulfilling of the law. Por
this I conceive to be a mere subterfuge, which is totally un-
necessary. 'I'he apostle in that place is demolishIng the 10011111
confidence of the Jews, who boasted of possessIng the exclusive
knowledge 01 the law, whilst at the same time they were the
greatest despisers 01 it. 'Po prevent such great sels-complaceuce

, on account of a merc acquaintance with the law, he admonishes

them, that if righteousness be sought by the law, it is requisita
not only to lrnow but to observa ·it. We certainly do not
question that the rIghteousness 01 the law consists in works,
nor that thIs righteousness consists in the worthiness and
meritos works. But still it cannot be proved that we are
justified by works, unless some person be produced who has
lulfilled the law. Thai Paul had no other meaning, is
sufficiently evident from the context. After having con-
demned the Gentiles and Jews indiscriminately 101 unright-
eousness, he proceeds particularly to Inform us, that “ as many
as have sinned without law shall also perish without law;”
which refers to the Gentiles; and that “as many as have
sinned in the law shall bc judged by the law; '² which belongs
to the Jews. Moreover, because they shut their eyes against
their transgressions, and gloricd in their mere possession 01 the
, law, he adds, what is exceedingly applicablc, that the law was
not given that men might be justified merely by hearing its
voice, but by obeying it, as though he had said, Do you scek
righteousness by the law? Plead not your having heard it, which
of itself is avery small advantage, but produce works asan evi-
dence that the law has not been gIven to you in vain. Since
in this respect they were all deficient, they were consequently
deprived of their glcrying in the latv. The meaning of Paul,
