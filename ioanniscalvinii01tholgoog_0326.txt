VI. But however this might be, let us examine what juris·
diction or power the Roman sce then possessed Now, ecclesias-
tical power consiste in these four things—the ordination of
bishops, the calling of councils, the hearing of appeals‚ or juris-
diction, and corrective admonitione, or censuras. All the ancient
councils command bishops to be ordainsd by their own metro·
politans3 and they never direct the bishop of Rome to be called
to this office except in his own province. By degrees, however,
a eustom was introduced for all the bishops of Italy to go to
Rome to be consecrated, except the metropolitana, who did not
suffer themselves robe subjected to this bondage. But when

There isan example of this in an epistle of Gregory, respecting
the consecration of Constantius, archbishop of Milan, after tha
death of laurentius. Ι do not suppose, however, that this was
a very ancient practice. It is probable that at first they sent
legates to each other, from a principle of respect and affection,
to witness the ordination, and testify their mutual communion;
and that what was originally voluntary‚ was afterwards consi·
deredas necessary. However this may be, it is evident that in
ancient times the bishop of Rome did not possess the power of
consecrating bishops, except in his own province, that is, in the

. Ghurches dependent upon his see, as is declared by one of the

canons of the Oouncil of Nice. Consecration was followed by
the sending of asynodical epistle 3 and in this the bishop of
Rome had no superiority over others⁴ It was the custom of
the patriarohs, immediately after their consecration, to make a
solemn declaration of their saith in s written communication to
their brothton, professing their adherence to the doctrine of the
holy and orthodox eouncils. Thus, by making a confession
of their saith, they mutually approved themselves to each other.
lf the bishop of Rome had received such a confession from
others, and not given it to other bishops in his turn, this would
have been an urstame of aclmowledged superiority3 but, as he
was under the same obligation to give it as to require it, and
was subject to the common law, it was certainly a token of
equality, and not of dominion. We have examples of this in
the epistles of Gregory to Anastasius and Cyriacus of constm· ⁸
tinople‚ and to all the patriarchs together.

bishops of Rome formerly employed them towards others, they
also received from others' rn their turn. irenaeus, bishop of
