treat them with contempt or carelessness, much less violate
them, in an open manner, through pride and obstinacy. It will
be asked, What kind of liberty os conscience can be retained
amidst so much attention and cantion? lreply, It will very
well be supported, when we consider, that these are not fixed
and perpetual laws by which we are bound, but extemel aids for
human infirmity, which though we do not need, yet we all
use, because we are under obligations to each other to cherish
mutual charity between us. This may be observed in the
exarnples already mentioned. What! does religion consist in
a womau’s veil, so that it would be criminal for her to walk
out with her face uncovered? Is the solemn decree respect-
ing her silence such as cannot be violated without a capital
offence? Is there any mystery in kneeling, or in the intermeat
of a dead body, which cannot be omitted without sin i Certainly
not; sor is a woman, iu the assistance of a neighbour, finds a
necessity sor such haste as allows her no time to cover her head,
she commits no offence in running to the place with her head
uncovered. And it is sometimes as proper for her to speak, as
at other times to be silent. And he who from disease is unable
to lrneel, is quite at liberty to pray standing. Lastly, it is
better to bury a dead body in proper season, even without a
shroud, than, sor wantos persons tc carry it to burial, to suffer
it to putrely without interment. Nevertheless,in these things,
the customs and laws os the country we inhabit, the dictates of
modesty, and even humanity itself, will direct us what to de,
and what to avoid3 and if an error be incurred through inad-
vertence or forgetsulness, no crime is committed 3 but is through
contempt, such perverseness deserves to he reprobated. So it
isos little importanee what days and hours are appointed, what
is the form os the places, what psalms are sung on the respective
days. But it is proper that there should be certain days and
stated hours, and a place capable os receiving all the people, is
any regard be paid to the preservation of peace. For what a
source os contentione would be produced by the confusiones
these things, if every man were permitted to change, at his
pleasure, what relatos to the general order, for it would never
happen that the same thing would be agreeable to all, is things
were undetermined and left to the choice of every individual.
If any one object, and resolve to be wiser on this subject than
is necessary, let him examine by what reason he can justisy
his obstinacy to the Lord. We ought, however, to be satisfied
with the declaration os Paul, “ Is any man seem to be conten-
tious, we have no such custom, nor the Churches of God.” (m)
