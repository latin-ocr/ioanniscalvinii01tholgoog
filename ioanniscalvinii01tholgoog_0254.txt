is any pardon for voluntary transgression! 1 maintain, that
there is nothing more evident, than that the one sacrifice of
Christ is available for the remissiori of the voluntary sins of the
saints, since the Lord has testified the same by the legal vic·
tims‚ as by so many types. Resides, who can plead ignorance
as an excuse for David, who was evidently so well acquainted
with the law? Did not David know that adultery and murder
were great crimes, which he daily punished in others? Did
the patriarchs consider fratricida as lawfuli Had the Corin·
thians learned so little that they could imagine impurity, incon·
tinence, fornication, animosities, and contentione, to be pleasing
to God? Could Peter, who had been so carefully warned, be
ignorant how great a crime it was to abjure his Master? lat
us not, therefore, by our eruelty, shut the gate of marey which
God has so liberally opened. ,

XXIX. Iam fully aware that the old writers have explained
those sins, which are daily forgiven to believers, to be the
smaller faults, which are inadvertently committed through the
infirmity of the flesh3 but solemn repentance, which was then
required for greater offences, they thought, was no moreto be
repeated than baptism. This sentiment isnot to be understood
aa indicating their design, either to drive into despair such per·
sons as had relapsed after their first repentance‚ or to extenuata
those errors‚ as if they were small in the sight of God. For they
knew that the saints frequently stagger through unbelief; that
they sometimes utter unnecessary oaths3 that they occasionally
swell into anger, and even break out into open reproaches3 and
that they ara likewise chargeabie with other faults, which ths
Lord holds in the greatest abomination. They expressed
themselves in this manner, to distinguish between private of·
feneas and those public crimes which were attended with great
scandal in the Ghurch. But the difficulty, which they made,
of forgiving those who had committed any thing deserving of
eeclesiastical censure, did not arise from arr opinion that it was
difficult for thern to obtain pardon from the Lord3 they only
intended by this severity to deter others from rashly running
into crimes, which would justly be followed by their exclusion
from the communion of the Cburch. 'l'ha word of the Lord,
however, which ought to be our only rule in this case, certainly
prescribes greater moderatiori. For it tenebas, that the rigon
of discipline ought not to be carried to such an extent, as to
overwhehn with sorrow the person whose benefit we are re·
quired to regard as its principal object; as we have before
shown mors at large.
