other hand, poverty, necessity, ignoblc birth, slovenliuess, con·
tempt, and the like. Thus Peter and Paul declare that God
isnot a respectet of persons, because he makes no differeuce
between the Jew and Greek, ιο reject one and receive the
other, merely en account of his nation. (s) So James uses
the same language when he means to assert, that God in his
judgment pays no regard ιο riches. (g) And Paul, in another
place, declares, that in judging, God has no respect to libertyor
bondage. (t) There will, therefore, be no contradiction in our
affirming, that according to the good pleasure of his will, God
chooses whom he will as his children, irrespective of all merit,
while he rejects end reprobates others. Yet, for the sake of
further satisfaction, the matter may be explained in the follow·
ing manner: They ask how it happens, that of two persons

’ distinguished from each other by no merit, God, in his election,

leaves one and takes another. l, on the other haud, ask them,
whether they suppose him that is taken tc possess any thing
that can attract the favour of God. If they confess that he has
not, as indeed they must, it will folloW, that God looks notat
man, but derives his motive to favour him from his own good·
ness. God's election of one man, therefore, while he rejects
another, proceeds net from any respect of man, but solely from
his own merey; which may freely display and exert itself
wherever and whenever it pleases. For we have elsewhere
seen also that, from the beginning, not many noble, or wisa, or
honourable were called, (i) that God might humble the pride
of flesh3 so far is his favour from being confined to persons.
XI. Wherefore some people falsely and wickedly charge
God with a violationes equal justice, because, in his predes-
tination, he observes uot the same uniform course of pro'ceeding
towards all. If he finds all guilty, they say, let him punish all
alike ; if innocent, let him withhold the rigour of justice from all.
But they deal with him just as if either mercy were forbidden
him, or, when he chooses to show mercy, he were constrained
wholly to renounce justice. What is it that they require?
lf all are guilty, that they shall all suffer the same punishment.
We confess the guilt to be common, but we say, that some are
relieved by Divine mercy. They say, Let it relieve all. But
we reply, Justice requires that he should likewise show him-
self to be a just judge in the indiction of punishment. When
they object to this, what is it but attempting to deprive God of
the opportunity to manifest his mercy, or to grant it to him, at
least, on the condition that he wholly abendon his justice?
Wherefore there is the greatest propriety iu these observatione
of Augustino: “The whole massof mankind having fallen into
