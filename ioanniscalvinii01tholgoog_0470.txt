the same reason, when the apostle exhorts the Ephesiaos to
“remember that'’ they “ were without Christ, being aliens
from the commonwealth of Israel, and strangers from the cove-
nant of promise, having no hope, and without God in the
world,’' he states that they were not partakers of circum·
cision;(v) thereby signifying that not having received the
signos the promise, they were excluded from the promise it·
self. 'I'o the other objection which they make, that the glory
of God is transferred to creatores to whom so much power is
attributed, and thereby sustains‘a proportionata diminution, it
is easy to answer, that we place no power in creatures; we
only malntain that God uses such means and instrurnents as he
sees will be suitable, in order that all things may be subservi-
ent to his glory‚ as he is the Lord and Ruler of all. Theresore,
as by bread and other alimenta he feeds our bodies, as by the
sun he enlightens the world, as by fire he produces warmth, -
yet bread, the sun, and fire, are nothing but instrumenta by
which he dispenses his blessings to us, - so hc nourishes our
saith in a spiritual manner by the sacraments, which are insti·
tuted for the purpose of placing his promises before our eyes
sor our contemplation, and of serving us as pledges of them.
And as we ought not to place any confidence in the other
creaturas, which, by the liberality and beneficence of God, have
been destined to our uses, and by whose instrumentality he
communicatas to us the bounties of his goodness, nor to admire
and celebrate them as the causes of our enjoyments, -so neither·
ought our confidence to rest in the sacraments, or the glory of
God to be transferred to them; but, forsalring all other things,
both our saith and confession ought toriae to him, the Author
of the sacramenta and of every other blessing.

XIII. 'I'he argument which some persons adduce from the
very name of ramaneant is destitute of any force ; -though
the word sacrament has various sigulfications in authors of the
first authority, yet it has but one which has any agreement or
connection with sr'gns or standards, (signa5) that is, when it
denotas the solemn oath taken by a soldier to his commender
when he enters on a military life. For as by the military cath
new soldiers bind themselves to their commender, and assume
the military profession, so by our signs wc profess Christ to
be our Leader, and declara that we fight under his banners.
They add similitudes for the further elucidation of their opin-
ion. As the dress of the Romans, who wore gowns, distin-
guished them from the Greeks, who wore cloalrs; as the differ·
ent orders among the Romans were distinguished from each ”
other by their respective badgea, the senatorial order from the
