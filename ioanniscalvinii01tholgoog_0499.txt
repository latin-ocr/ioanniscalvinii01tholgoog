when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Gbost came
on them.” The latter clause describes the kind of baptism
intended in the former. Is ignorance vitiate a first baptism, so
that it requires to be corrected by a second, the first persons
who ought to have been rebaptized were the apostles them·
selvas, who sor three years after their baptism had scarcely any
knowledge of the least particle os pure doctrine. And among
us, what rivers would be sufficient for the repetition os ablu·
tious as numerous as the errors which are daily corrected in us
by the merny of the Lord!

XIX. The virtue, dignity, utility, and end os this mystery‚
have now, if Ι mistake not, been sufficiently explained. With
respect to the external symbol, Ι sincerely wish that the genuine
institution of Christ had the influence it ought to bave, to re·
press the audacity of man. For, as though it were a contempt·
ible thing to be baptized in water, according to the preceptor*
Christ, men have invented a benediction, or rather incantation‚
to pollute the true consecration of the water. They afterwards
added a wax taper with chrism3 exorcism seemed to open the
gate to baptism. Now, though 1 am not ignorant os the an·
cient origin of this adventitious medley, yet it is lawiul sor me
and for all believers to reject every thing that men bave pre·
sumed to add to the institution oi Christ. Now, Satan, seeiug
that from the very first introduction of the gospel, his impos·
tures had been easily received by the soolisb credulity of the
world, proceeded to grosser illusions; hence spittle, salt, and
other sooleries, which were publicly introduced with an un-
limited linense, to the reproach of baptism. From these ex-
periments we may leam that there is nothing holier, or better,
or safer, than to content ourselves with the authority of Christ
alone· How much better was it, therefore, omitting all the·
atrical pompe which dazzle the eyes and stupeiy the minds os
the simple, whenever any oue was to be baptized, that hc
should be presented to the congregation os believers, aud
be offered to God in the presence and with the prayors oi the
whole Church3 that the confession of saith, in which the catc-
chumen was to be instructed, should be recited; that the pro·
mises which are included iu baptism should be declared; that
the catechumen should be baptizet in the name os the Father,
of the Son, aud os the Holy Ghost; aud lastly, that ho should
be dismissed with prayers and thanlrsgivings! Thus uothiug
material would be omitted; arrd that oue cercmouy, which was
