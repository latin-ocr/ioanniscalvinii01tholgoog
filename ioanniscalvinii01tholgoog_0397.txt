mon peace, and to maintain concord3 if in the transaction of
business there is always some order, which the interest of puh-
lic virtue, anderen of humanity itself, forbids to be rejected;
the same ought particularly to be observed in Ohurches, which
are best supported by a well-ordered regulation ol all their
affairs, and which without concord are no Ohurches at all.
Wherefore, if we would make a proper provision for the safety
of the Ghurch, we ought to pay the strictcst attention to the
injunction of Paul, that “all things be done decently and in
order.'¹ (i) But as there is such great diversity in the manners
of men, so great a variety in their minda, and so much con-
trariety in their judgments and inclinations, no polity will be
sufficiently steady unless it be established by certain laws; nor
can any order be preserved without some settled form. The
laws, therefore, which promote this end, we are so far frorn con·
demning, that, we contend, their abolition would be followed
by a disruption of the bands of union, and the total disorgani-
ration and dispersion of the Ghurches. For it is impossible to
attain what Paul requires, that “all things be done decently
and in order,” unless order and decorum be supported by ad-
ditional regulations. But in regard to such regulations, cara
must always he taken, that they be not considered necessary
to salvation‚ and so imposing a religious obligation on the con·
science, or applied to the worship of God, and so represented
as essential to piety.

XXVIII. We have an excellent and most certain mark,
therefore, which distinguishes those impious constitutions, by
which it has been stated that true religion is obscured and
men's consciencas subverted, and the legitimate regulations of
the Church, which are always directed to one of these two
ends, or to both together, that, in the holy assembly of believ-
ers, all things may be conducted with suitable decorum and
dignity, that the community may be kept in order by the
firm bonds of courtesy and moderatiori. For when it is once
understood that a law is made for the sake of public order, this
removes the superstition embraced by them who place the
worship of God in human inventione. Moreorer, when it is
known that it only refers to matters of common practice, this
overturns all that false notion of obligation and necessity, which
filled men's consciences with great terror, when traditione were
thought necessary to salvation‚ For here nothing is required
but tbe maintenanca of charity among us by tha common in-

tercourse of friendly offices. But it is proper to describe more
fully what is comprehended under the decorum and the order
which Paul recommends. The end of decorum is, partly, that
