we see how be sustains the character of amost provident Fa·

after our death, but regards and provides for our children.
Ougbt weriot, then, after the example of David, to exult in
praise and tbanksgiving to God with our whole beart, that bis

This is evidently tbe reason why Satan makes sucb great ex·
ertions in opposition to infant baptism ; that the removal of

quet, in wbich Christ testifies himself to be the broad of life,
to feed our souls for a true and blessed immortality. Now, as
the knowledge of so great a mystery is highly necessary, and
on account of its importance, requires an accurate explicati0n3
and, on the otber band, as Satan, in order to deprive tbe Cburcb
