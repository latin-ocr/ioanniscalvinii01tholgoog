tion of grace, the inequality of which demonstrates it to be
truly gratuitous. Therefore Malaehi aggravatos the ingratitudo
of Israel, because, though not only elected out os the whole
race os mankind, but also separated from a sacred family to be
apeculiar people, they perfidiously and impiously despised God
their most beneticent Fatber. “Was not Esau Jacob's bro-
ther? saith the Lord : yet 1 loved Jacob, and 1 hated Esau.'’ (s )
For God takes it for granted, since both were sons of a holy
father, successore of the eovenant, and branchos from a sacred
root, that the children of Jacob were already laid under more
than common obligations by their admission to that honour;
but Esau the first-bom having been rejected, and their father,
though inferior by birth, having been made the heir, he proves
them guilty of double ingratitudo, and complains of their vio·
lating this twofold claim.

Vll. Though it is sufficiently clear, that God, in his secret
eounsel, freely chooses whom he will, and rejects others, his
gratuitous election is but half displayed till we corne ιο particu-
lar individuale, ιο whom God not only offers salvation, but as·
signs it in aucha manner, that the certaimy of the effect is
liable to no suspense or doubt. These are included in that
one seed mentioned by Paul ; for though the adoption was de·
posited in the hand of Abraham, yet many of his posterity
being cut off as putrid members, in order to maintain the effi·
cacy and stability of election, itis necessary to ascend to the
head, in whom their heavenly Father has bound his elect to
each other, and united them to himself by an indissoluble
bond. Thus the adoption of the family of Abraham displayed
the favour of God, which he denied ιο others3 but in the
members of Christ there is a conspicuous exhibition of the

from the passage of Malachi which 1 have just quoted, that
where God, introducing the eovenant of eternal life, invites any
people ιο himself, there is a peculiar lrind of oleotion as to part
of them, so that he does not efficaciously choose all with indis-
criminate grace. The declaration, “Jacob have 1 loved,’' re·

there opposes to the descendants of Esau. Yet this is no ob-
jection ιο our having in the person of one individual a specimen
of the electiori, which can never fail of attaining its full effect.
These, who truly belong to Christ, Paul correctly observes, are
called “a remnant;'' for experience proves, that of a great

only small portion remains. That the general election of a
