God, without the authority of his word, and to trample the
Scriptura under our feet? which so frequently prouounces our
carnal wisdom to be hostile to the wisdom of God; totally
condemns the vanity of our mind; aud directs all our reason
to be laid in the dost, and the Divine will to be the sole object
of our regard.

XXV. The other testimonias of Scripture which they ad·
duce in defence of this false doctrine, they distort with the
greatest perverseness. But Jacob (they say) prays that his
own name, and the name of his fathers, Abraham and Isaac,
might be named on his posterity. (r) Let us first inquire the
form of this naming, or calling on their names, among the.
Israelites; for they do not invoke their fathers to assist them ;
but they beseech God to remember his servants Abraham, Isaac,
and Jacob. Their example, therefore, is no vindication of those
who address tha saints themselves. But as these stupid mor·
tals understand neither what it is to name the uame of Jacob,
nor sor what reason it should be named, we need not won-
der that they so childishly err even in the form itself. This
phrasaology more than once occurs in the Scripturas For
Isaiah says, that the name of the husband is “called upon ’² the
wife who lives under his care and protection. The naming or
calling, therefore, of the name of Abraham upon the Israelites,
consists in their deducing their genealogy from him, and re·
vering and celebrating his memory as their great progenitor.
Neither is Jacob actuated by a solicitude for perpetuating the
celebrity of his name, but by a knowledge that all the happi-
ness of his posterity consisted in the inheritance of that cove-
nant which God had made with him: and perceiving that this
would be the greatest of all blessings to them, he prays that
they may be numbered among his children; which is only
transmitting to thern the succession of the covenant. They,
on their part, when they introduce the mention of this in their

prayers, do not recur to the intercessione of the dead, but put .

the Lord in remembrance of his covenaut, in which their most
merciful Father has engaged to be propitious and beneficent
to them, for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. How
little the saints depended in any other sense on the merits
of their fathers, is evinced by the public voice of the Ohurch
in the prophet: “Thou art our Father, though Abraham bc
ignorant of us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, OLord,
art our Father, our Redeemer.'’(s) And when they thus
express themselves, they add at the same time, “O Lord,
return, for thy servants’ salte, '² yet not entertaining a thought
of any intercession, but adverting to the blessing of the cove-
