another place: “But take heed lest by any means this liberty
os yours become astumbling-blook to them that are weak.’' (w)
again: “Whatsoever is sold in the shambles, that eat3 ask·
ing no questions sor conscience’ sake ; conscience, 1 say, not
thine own, but os the other.'' ln short, “Give none offence,
neither to the lewe, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church os
God.'’ (a) In another place also: “Brethren, ye have been
called unto liberty; only use not liberty sorau occasion to the
flesh‚ but by love serve one another.” (y) The meaning os
this is, that our liberty is not given us to be used in opposition
to our weals neighbours, to whom charity obliges us to do
every possible service ; but rather in order that, having peace
with God in our minds, we may also live peaceably among
men. But how much attention should be paid toan offence
taken by Pharisees, we leam from our Lord’s injunctiou, ‘¹ Let
them alone3 they be blind leaders of the blind.” (z) The
disciples had informed him, that the Pharisees were offended
with his discourse. He replies that they are to be let alone,
and their offence disregarded.

Xll. But the subjectis still pending in uncertainty, unless
we know whom we are to account weak, and whom we are to
consider as Pharisees; without which distinction, 1 see no nse

tended with the greatest danger. But Paul appears tome to
have very clearly decided, both by doctrine and examples, how
far our liberty should be either moderated or asserted on the
occurrence os offences. When he made Timothy his associate,
he circumcised him 3 (a) but could not be induced to circum·
eise Titus. (b) Here was a difference in his proceedings, but
no change of mind or of purpose. In the circumcision of Ti·
mothy, “ though he was free from all men, yet he made himself
servant unto all ; ’' and says he, “ Unto the Jews I became as a
Jew, that I might gain the Jews ; to them that are under the
laW, as under the law, that I might gain them that are under
the law: Iam made all things to all men, that I might by all
means save some.'’ (e) Thus we have a proper moderatiou of
liberty, if it may be indifferently restricted with any advantage.
His reason sor resolutely resraining from circumcising Titus,
he declares in the following words: “But neither Titus, who
was with me, being a Greek, was compelled to be circumcised3
and that because of false brethren unawares brought in, who
came in privily to spy out our liberty which we have in Christ
Jesus, that they might bring us into bondage3 to whom we
