example of the apostles, and in defiance of the express pro·
hiwtion of God.

ll. Every thing pertainiug tc the perfect rule of a holy
life, the Lord has comprehended in his law, so that there re·
mains nothing for men to add to that summary. And he has
done this, first, that, since all rectitude of life consiste in the
conformity of all our actions to his will, as their standard, we
might consider him as the sole Master aud Director of our
conduct; and secondly, to show that he requires of us nothing
more than obedieuce. For this reason, James says, “ He that
judgeth his brother, judgeth the law; butif thou judge the
law, thou art not a doer of the law, but a judge. There ia
one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy.’'(a) We
hear that God asserta this as his peculiar and exclusive preroga·
tire ; to govem us by the empire and lawa of his word. And the
same sentiment had before been expressed by lsaiah, though in
terms not quite so explicit: “ The Lord is our Judge, the Lord is
our Lawgiver, the Lord is our King, he will save us.” (t) Both

No man can assume this to himself. It follows therefore, that
God ought to be acknowledged as the only King of souls, who
alone has power to save and to destroy, or, in the language of
lsaiah, as the King, Judge, Legislator, and Saviour. Wherefore
Peter, when he admonishes pastore of their duty, exhorta them
“to seed the floclr, not as being lords over God’s heritage,” (v)
or the company of believers lf we duly consider this point,
that it is not lawful to transfer to man that which God appro-
priates solely to himself, we shall understand that this cuts off
all the power which is claimed by those who wish to exalt them·
selvas to command any thing in the Church, unsanctioned by
the word of God.

Vlll. Now, as the whole argument rests here, that, if God
is the sole legislator, it is not lawful formen to assume this
honour tn themselves-we ought also to bear in mind the
two reasons which we have stated, why God asserts this ex-
clusively to himself. The first is, that his will may be re·
ceived as the perfect rule of all righteousness and holinese, and
so that an acquaintance with it may be all the knowledge

necessary to a good life. The second is, that with respect to .

the mode of worshipping him aright, he may exercise the sole
empire over our souls, to whom we are under the strongest
obligation to obey his authority and aweit his commanda
When these two reasons are lrept in view, it will be easy to
judge what constitutions of men are contrary to the word of
