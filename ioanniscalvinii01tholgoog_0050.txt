precepts (b) I will further' inquire, lf there' rs any work
which does not deserve the charge of unpurity or imperfec-
tione (c ) But how could thisbe possible before those eyes, in
which the stars are not sufficiently pure, nor the angels suffi-
ciently righteous? Thus 116 will be compelled to concede, that
there is not 6 good work to be found, which is not too much

polluted, both by its own imperfectiori and by the transgressione
with which it is attended, to have any claim to the honourable
appellation of rigbteousners. Now, if it be evidently in con·

his approbation, arc imputed 161 righteousness, -why do they
attempt, by boasting of the righteousness 61 works, to destroy the
, rightcousness of saith, from which all righteousness of works pro·
ceeds? But do they wish to produce a vipereus offspring ro de-
stroy the parent? For such is the true tendency of this impious
doctrine. They cannot deny that justification by faith is the be·
ginning, foundation, cause, motivo, and substance of the right·
eousncss 61 works ς yet they conclude, that aman is not justified
by saith because good worlrs also are imputed for righteousness.
Let us therefore leave these impertinences‚ and acknowledge
the real state 61 the case ; if all thc righteousncss which can be
attributed to works depends 611 justification by faith, the latter is ,
not only not diminished, but, on the contrary, is confirmed by it3
since its influance appears the more extensive. . But let us not

men, or divide that office with saith. For unless justification
by faithremain always unimpaired, the tmpurity of their worlrs
will be detected. Nor rs there any absurdity 111 saying‚ theta
man is so justified by faith, that hc rs not only righteous him:
self, but that even his 11161111 are accouuted righteous beyond
what they deservo.

X. ln this way we will admit, not only a partial righteous-
ness of works, which our opponents maintain‚ but such esis
approved by God, as though it were perfect and complete. A
remembrance of the foundation on which it stands will solve
every difficulty. For no worlr is ever acceptable, till it be
received with pardon. Now, whence proceeds pardon, but from
God's beholding us and all our actions in Christi When we
are ingrafted into Christ, therefore, as our persons appear right·
eous before God, because our iniquities ara covered by his
righteousness, so our worlrs are accouuted righteous, because
the sinfulness otherwise belonging to thern is not imputed, be· ‘
ing all buried in the purity of Christ. So we may justly
