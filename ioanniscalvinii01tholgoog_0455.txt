XVI. By this comparisou of ancient and modern monachiam
Itrust lhave succeeded in my design of evincing the fallacy
of the plea, which the present men os the hood allege in de·
fence of their profession, from the example of the primitive
Ghurch3 as they differ from the early monks just as apes do
from men. At the same time, I admit that even in the ancient
system which Augustine commends, there is something which
1 cannot altogether approve. l grant, they discovered no
superstition iu the externa] exercises of a too rigid discipline ;
but 1 maintain that they were not free from excessive affecta·
tion and misguided zeal. lt seemed a good thing to forsake
their property in order to exempt themselves from all earthly
solicitude3 but God sets a higher value on pious exertions for
the government of a family, when a holy father of a family,
free from all avarica, ambition, and other corrupt passions,
devotas himself to this object, that he may serve God iu a
particular calling. Itis abeautiful thing to live the life of a
· philosopher in retirement, at a distance from the society of

act as if he hated all mankind, withdrawing to the solitude
of a desert, and abandoning the priucipal duties which the
Lord has commanded. Though we should grant that there
was no other evil in this profession, yet certainly this was not
a small one, that it introduced a useless and pernicious example
into the Ohurch.

XVII. Let us now examine the nature of the vows by
which monks in the present day ere initiated into this cele-
brated order. In the first place, their design is to institutes
new service, in order to merit the favour of God; therefore
l conclude, from the principles already established, that what-
ever they vow is an abomination in the sight of God. Se-
condly, without any regard to the calling of God, and without

1 maintain it to be a rash and unlawful attempt, because their
consciences have nothing to rest upon before God, and “ whatso-
ever is not of saith, is siu.'' (r) Thirdly, they bind themselves
to many corrupt and impious services, comprehended in the
monachiam of the present day; therefore 1 contend, that they
