nothing good, then, can proceed from usbut as we are regene-
rated, andour regenerationis, without exception, entirely ofGod,
we have uo right to arrogata to ourselves the smallest particle
of our good works. Lastly, while they assiduously inculcem
good works, they at the sarne time instnrct the consciences of
men in such amanner, that they ean never dare to be coufi-
dent that God is propitians and favonrable to their worka
But, on the contrary, our doctrine, without any mention of
merit, animatas the minda of believers with peculias consola·
tion, while wc teach them that their works are pleasing to
God, and that their persons are undoubtedly accepted by him.
And we likewise require, that uo man attempt or undertake
any work without faith; that is, unless he cau previously
determine, with a certain confidence of mind, that it will be
pleasing to God.

Vlll. Wherefore let us not suffer ourselves to be seduced
even a hair's breadth from the only foundation, on which,
when it is laid, wisc architects erect a tirm aud regular super·
structure. For if there be a necessity for doctrine and exhor·
tation, they apprize us, that “for this purpose the Son of God
was manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil3

,shown that Christ chooscs such for his disciples as will deuy
themselves, take up their cross, and follow him. (q) He who has
denied himself, has laid the axe to the root of all evils, that he
may no longer seek those things which are his own3 he who
has taken up his crass, has prepared himself for all patience and
gentleness. But the example os Christ comprehende not only
these, but all other duties of piety and holiness. He was
obedient to his Pather, even to death3 he was entirely occu-
pied in performing the worlrs of God3 he aspired with his
whole saul to promote the glory of his Father ; hc laid down
his life for his brethrcn3 he both acted and prayed for the
benefit of his enemies. But if there be need of consolation,
these passages will afford it in a wonderful degree: “We are
troubled on every side, yet not distressed; we are perplexed,
but not in despair; persecuted, but not forsalreu3 cast down,
but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the
dying of the Lord Jesus‚ that the life also of Jesus might be
made manifest in our body.’'(r) “Is we be dead with him,
