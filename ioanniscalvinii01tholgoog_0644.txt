consess to be superfluous, il the kingdom os God, as it now
exists in us, extinguishes the present lise. But if it is the will of
God, that while we are aspiring towards our true country, we
be pilgrims on the earth, and is such aids are necessary to our
pilgrimage, they who take thern from man deprive him os his
human natrue. They plead that there should be so much perlec-
tion in the Church of God, that its order would suffice to supply
the place ol all laws; but they soolishly imagine a perlection ι
which can never be found in any community of men. For ⁴*
since the insolence os the wicked is so great, and their iniquity
so obstinate that it cau scarcely be restrained by all the severity
of the laws, what may we expect they would do, il they found
themselves at liberty to perpetrate crimes with impunity, whose
outrages even the arm of power cannot altogether prevent? . ,

111. But sor speaking of the exercise of civil polity, there
will be another place more suitable. At present we only wish
it to be understood, that to entertain a thought of its extermi-
nation‚ is inhumau barbarism; it is equally as necessary to
mankind as bread and water, light and air, arrd sar more excel-
lent. For it not only tends to secure the accommodations
arising from all these things, that men may breathe‚ eat, drink,
and be sustained in lile, though it comprehends all these things
while it causes them to live together, yet, ll say, this is not its
only tendency3 its objects also are, that idolatry, sacrileges
against the name os God, blasphemias against his truth, and
other offences against religion? may not openly appear and be
disseminated among the peope; that the publio tranquillity
may not be disturbed; that every person may enjoy his proper·
ty without molestation; that men may transact their business
together without lraud or injustice; that integrity and modesty
may be cultivated among them; in short, that there may be
apublic formos religion among Christians, and that humanity
may be maintained among men. Nor let any one think it
strange that I now refer to human polity the charge os the due
maintenance of religion, which Imay appear to have placed
beyond the jurisdiction of men. For I do not allow mento
make laws respecting religion and the worship ol God now,
any more than I did before3 thouglysl approve of civil govern-
ment, which provides that the true religion which is contained
in the law ot' God, be uot,violated, and polluted by public
blasphemies, with impunity! But the perspicuity of order will
assist the readers to attain a clearer understanding of what sen·
timents ought to be entertained respectiug the whole system
of civil administration, il we euterun a discussion os each
branch os it. These are three: The magistrate, who is the
guardian and conservator of the laws : . The laws, according to
which he govems: The people, who are govemed by the lawa,
