Ido not say enough. Bishoprics are the rewards of adulterers
and pendere For when they ara given to hunters and fowlers,
the business must be considered as well managed. To attempt
any excuse of such flagitious proceedings is abominable. 'I'he
pcople, l say, had a most excellent canon, in the direction uf the
word of God, that “abishop must be blameless, apt to teach, no
striker,’' doc. (i) Why, then, was the right ofelection transfened
'from the people to the canons? They reply, Because the word
of God was not attended to, amidst the tumults and factiuns of
the pcople. And why should it not now be again transferred
from them, who not only violate all laws, but, casting off all
shame, mingle and confound heaven and earth together, by
their lust, avarica, and ambition?

111. But it is a false pretence when they say, that the pre·
sent practice was introduced as a remedy. We read that in the
early times, cities were frequently thrown into confusion at the
election of their bishops3 yet no one ever dared to think of
depriving the citizens of their right. For they had other ways,
either of guarding against these evils, or of correcting them
when they occurred. But 1 will state the real truth of the case.
When the people began to be negligent about choosing, and,
consideriug this care as less suitable to themselves, left it to
the presbyters, the latter abused this occasion to usurp a tyran·
nical power, which they afterwards confirmed to themselves by
new canons. Their form of ordination is no other than a mere
moolrery. For the appearance of examination which they dis·
play in it, is so frivolous and jejune, that it is even destituta
of all plausibility. 'Phe power of nominating bishops, there·
fore, which some princes have obtained by stipulation with
the Roman pontifi, has caused no new injury to the Ohurch,
because the election has only been taken from the canons, who
had seized, or rather stolen, it without any just claim. lt is
certainlya most disgraccful example, that courtiers are made
bishops, and sent from the court to seize upon the Churcbes;
and it ought to be the concern of all pious princes to refrain
from such an abuse. For it is an impious robbery of the
Church, whenever abishop is imposed upon any pcople, who
have not desired, or at least freely approved of him. But the
disorderly custom which has long prevailed in the Charches,
has given occasion to princes to assume the premntation of
bishops to themselves. For they would rather have this at
their own disposal, than in the hands of those who hed no more
right to it, and by whom it was not less abused.

bishops boast of being sucoessors of the apostles 'l’he power
