body? Hes it not its proper and certain dimensione? isit not
contained in some particular place, and capable of being felt
and seen? And why, say they, may not God cause the sante
flesh to occupy many different-places, to be contained in no
particular place, and to have no form or dimensions? But how
can they be so senseless as to require the power of God to
cause a body to be abody, and not to beabody, at the same
time? lt is like demanding of him to cause light to be at once
both light and darkness. But he wills light to be light, dark-
ness to be darkness, and flesh to be flesh. Whenever it shall
bohis pleasure, indeed, he will turn darkness into light, aud
light into darkness 3 bnt to require that light and darkness shall
no longer be different, is to aim at perverting the order of
Divine wisdom. Therefore body must be body, spirit must
be spirit, every thing must be subject to that law, and retain
that condition, which was fixed by Cod at its creation. And
the condition of a body is such, that it must occupy one par·
ticular place, and have its proper form and dimensione. In
this condition did Christ assume a body, to which, as Augus-
tine observes, “he gave incorruption and glory‚ but without
depriving it of its nature and reality.’' The testimony of the
Scriptura is clear-that he ascended to heaven, whence he
will come again, in like manner as he was seen to ascend. (y)

the letter of Scripture; but just as did the Anthropomorphites
in pest ages, who represented God to be corporeal 3 just as did
Marcion and the Manichaeans, who attributed to Christ a celes·
tial or visionary body. For they quoted these texts: “The
srrst man is of the earth, earthy; the second man is the Lord
from heaven.'’ (z) “Christ made himself of no reputation, and
took upon him the formos a servant, and was made in the ’
likeness of men.” (a) These graveling souls imagine that
God can have no power, unless the whole order of nature bo
reversed by the monster which they have fabricated in their
own brains; but this is an attempt to circumscribe God, and to
measure his power by the sancies of men. For from what
word have they learned that the body of Christ is visible in
heaven, and yet is on earth, concealed in an invisible manner
under innumerable pieces of bread? They will say that ne-
cessity requires this, in order to thc body os Christ being given

in the supper. The truth is, that when they had determined
to conclude, from the language of Christ, that his body was
