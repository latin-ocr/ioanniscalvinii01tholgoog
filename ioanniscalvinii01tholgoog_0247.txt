for the oblation of separate sacrifices; bnt whatever were the
characters of the people, yet because they considered that
God had deposited his word among that nation, and instituted
, the ceremonies in which he was there worshipped, they lifted

these services, surely they would have suffered a hundred deaths
rather than have permittcd themselves to be dragged to them.
There was nothing therefore to prevent their departure from
them, but the desire of preserving the unity of the Ohnrch.
But if the holy prophets were restrained by a sense of duty
from forsaking the Ohurch on account of the numerous and
enormous crimes which were practised, not by a few individuale,
but almost by the whole nation,-it is extreme arrogance in ns,
if we presume immediately to withdraw from the communion
of a Ohurch where the conduct of all the members is not com·
patible either with our judgment‚ or even with the Christian
rofession.
p XIX. Now, what kind of an age was that of Christ and his
apostles? Yet the desperate impiety of the Pharisecs, and the
dissolute lives every where led by the people, could not prevent
them from using the same sacrifices, and resembling in the sarne
temple with others, for the public exercises of religion. How
did this happen, but from a knowledge that the society of the

remarked, “ Although tares, or impure vessels, are found in the
Ghurch, yet this is not a reason why we should withdraw from

to use our utmost endeavours and exertions, that we may be
vessels of gold or of silver. But to brealr in pisces the vessels
of earth belongs to the Lord alone, to whom a rod of ironis also

the province of the Son of God, by pretending to fan the floor,
clear away the chais, and separate all the tares by the Judgment
of man. This is prond obstinacy and sacrilegious presumption,
originating in a cornrpt frenzy.” Let these two points, then,
be considered as decided; first, that he who voluntarily deserts
the external communion of the Ohnrch where the word of God
is preached‚ and the sacramente are administered, is without
any excuse ς secondly, that the fanlts either of few persons or
of many, form no obstacles to adue profession of our faith in
the use of the ceremonies instituted by God3 because the pious
conscience is not wounded by the unworthiness of any other
individual, whether he be a pastor or a private person ς nor are
