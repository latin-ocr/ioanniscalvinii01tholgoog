Xll. l consess that there was the greatest propriety in the
docrec os the Council of Laodicea, that the election should not
be lest to the populace. For it scarcely ever happens that so
many heads concur in one opinion sor the settlernent os any
business; and almost every case verifies the observation, that
the uncertain vulgar are divided by contrary inclinations. But
to this danger was applied an excellent remedy. For in the
first place, the clergy alone made their choice, and presented
the person they had chosen to the magistracy, or to the senate
and governors. They deliberated on the election, and if it ap·
peared to thern a proper one, confirmed it, or otherwise chose
another person whom they preferred. Then the business was
referred to the multitude, who, though they were nor bound to
concur in these previous opinions, yet were less likely to be
thrown into disorder. Oris the business commenced with the
multitude, this method was adopted in order to discover who
was the principal object of their wishes; and after hearing the
wishes of the people, the clergy proceeded to the election.
Thus the clergy were neither at liberty to elect whom they

· pleased, nor undere necessity of complying with the foolish

desires os the people. This order is stated by Leo in another
place, when he says, “ lt is requisito to have the votes of the
citizens, the testimonies os the people, the authority os the
governorS, and the electiori os the clergy.'' Again: “ Let there
be the testimony of the governors, the subscription of the
clergy, the consent of the senate and people. Reason permits
it not to be done in any other way.’' Nor is there any other
meaning in that decree of the Council os Laodicea, than that
the clergy and governors should not suffer themselves to be
carried away by the inconsiderate multitude, but by their pru·
dence and gravity should check, on every necessary occasion,
the folly and violence of popular desires. ,

Xlll. This mode of election was still practised in the time
of Gregory, and it is probable that it continued long after.
There are many of his epistles which furnish sufficient evi-
dence of⁴ this fact. For in every case relating to the creation
os a new bishop in any place, he was accustomed to write to
the clergy, the senate, aad the people; and sometimes to the
duke, according to the constitution of the government in the
placo to which he was writing. And it, on account of distur-
bances or dissensions in any Church, hc confides the superin-
tendence of the election to some neighbouring bishop, yet he
invariably requires a solemn decree confirmed by the subscrip
tions os all. Even when one Constantius was created bishop
of Milan, and on account of the incursions os the barbarians,
many of the Milanese had retired to Genoa, he thought the
electiori would not be legitimare, unless they also were called
