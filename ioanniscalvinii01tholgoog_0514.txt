which he imparts to whom he pleases; but that the Jews
have no reason sor satisfaction, or glorying in the name ot
the covenant, unless they observe the law of the covenant3
that is, obey the Divine word. Yet, aster having demolishcd
their vain confidence in their descent, knowing, on the other
hand, that the covenant which God had once made with the
posterity of Abraham could by no means be invalidated, he
argues, that the natural descendants are not to be deprived of
their dignity; by virtue os which he shows that the Jews
were the first and natural heirs of the gospel, only that they

had been rejected as unworthy, on account os their ingratitnde, “

yet that the heavenly benediction had not entirely departed
from their nation. For which reason, though they were re·
bels and violatore of the covenant, yet he calls them holy;
such high honours does he give to the holy generation, which
God honoured with his sacred covenant; but he considers us,
in comparison with them, as the posthumous, and even abor-
tive children of Abraham, and that not by nature, but by
adoption ; as is a branch broken off srom its native tree were
tantm intitulant tfn
gospel to be 1iirst dnnouirced to the’m3 sor they are, ds it rwere,
the first-bom in the family of God. Wheresore this honour
wasto be given to them, till they rejected the offer of it, and
by their ingratitnde caused it to be transferred to the Gentiles.
Nor, whatever be the obstinacy with which they persist in
opposing the gospel, ought they, on that account, to be de·
spised by us, ifwe consider that, for the sake of the promise,
the blessing of God still remains among them, as the apostle
clearly testities that it will never entirely depart from them,
“ for the gista and calling of God are without repentance.'’ (m)

XV. See, now, the importance and the estimate to be formed
of the promise given to the posterity of Abraham. Theresore,
though we have no doubt that the distinction ot‘ the heirs of
the kingdom from those who have no share in it, is the free
actos the sovereign election of God, yet, at the same time, wc
perceive that he has been pleased to display his mercy ina
peculiar manner on the seed of Abraham, and to testisy and
secl it by circumcision. 'Phe same reason is applicable to ’
the Christian Church. For as Paul, in that passage, ar-
gues that the children os the Jews were sanctified by their
parents, so, in another place, (n) he teaches that the chil-
dren os Christians derive the same sanctification srom their
parents; whence it is inserted, that they who, on the contrary,
are condemned as impure, arc deservedly separated from others.
