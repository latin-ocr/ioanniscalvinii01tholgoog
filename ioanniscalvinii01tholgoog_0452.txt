tud is ne otherwise insufficient ιο conduct us to salvationi,
than in consequence os our dspruvity. By this answer Christ
declar-ad, that he taught ne other system os lise then that
which had nnciently been delivered in the law οῖ ῦοά, Thus
he at the sarna time gave a testimony to the divine law as the
doctrine os perfect righteousness, end precluded ell cnlumnies,
thet he might not appear, by inculcating a new rule oi* lise, tn
incite the people to n departure from the law. The young
mnu, not indeed from bedness ot· heart, but insected with vain
confidence, replies respecting the precepts os the law, “All
these things have 1 kept from rny youth up.” (p) 12 is certain
beyond all doubt, that he wes et an immense distance froin
that which he boasted of having etteined5 and had his boast
been true, he would have wanted nothing necessary to com-
plete perfectiori. For it has been alresdy proved thet the
lnw contains iu itself e perfect righteousness; and it appears
from tliis passage that the observance os it is called the entrance
into etei-nal life. To teech him hnw little proficieney he hed
made in that righteeusness, which he too cenfldently replied
that he had fulfflled, it was necessary to investigate end ex-
pone avice which lay conceeled in his hurt, He abounded
inriches, and his henrt was fixed on them. Beeeime he was
not sensible os this secret wound, therefore, Christ robes it.

loves Gnd with ull hie heart, not only esteemsas worthless
whatever is inconsistent with his love, bui elno abominetes it
aa pernicioue. Theresore, when Christ commannis a rich end
amiciens man to relinquish all his weslth, it is just the
mess ii' he commended an amhitiousmm to renounce all
his honours, ιι voluptuous men to abendon au his delicncies,
and nn uncheste mnu ιο sorsske all the instrumente os tempta-
tion. Thus conscience«, which receive ιιο impression from geu-
ernl admonitione, require ιο be recaned to a particular sense ef
their own guilt. It is in vain, therefore, to extend this perticulnr
argument to a general maxim, us though Christ placed ell the per·
fection os meu in the renunciatien of his possessione, whereas
he only meant by this direction to drive thiu young men, who
betrayed such excessive sels-complacency, imo ι sense os his
melsdy, that he might perceive himself to be still very t'nr
from the perfect obedience oi* the law, tc which he arrogantly
