without intermission‚ yet as our weakuess requires many as·
sistances, aud our indolence needs to be stimulated, we ought
every one of us, for the sake of regularity, to appoint particular
hours which should not elapsa without prayer, and which
should witness all the affectione of the mind entirely engaged
iu this exercise3 as, when we risa in the morning, before we
enter on the business of the day, when we sit down to meat,
when we have been fed hythe Divino blessing, when we re·
tire to rest. This must not be a superstitious observanee of
hours, by which, as if dischargiug our debt to God, we may
fancy ourselves dischargcd from all obligation for the remain-
ing hours; but adiscipline for our wealrnese, which may thus,
from time to time, be exercised and stimulated. It must es·
pecially be the object of our solicitous care, whenever we are
oppressed, or see others oppressed‚ with adversity‚ immediately
to resort to him with eelerity, not of body, but of mind ς second-
ly, to suffer no prosperity of our own or others to pass with·
out testifying our acknowledgment of hie hand by praise and
thauksgiving3 lastly, we must carafully observa this iu every
prayer, that we entertain not the thought of binding God to cer·
tain circumstances, or prescribing to him the time, the place, or
the manner of his proceedings. As we are taught by this prayer
to fix no law, to impone no condition on him, but to leave it to
his will to do what he intends, in the manner, at the time,
and in the place he pleaees, therefore, before we form a peti·
tion for ourselves, we first pray that his will may be done;
thereby submitting our will to his, that, being, as it were, bridled
and restrained‚ it may not presume to regulata God, but may
constitute him the arbiter and ruler of all its desires

LL If, with minda composod to this obedienoe, we suffer
ourselves to be governed by the lawe of Divina Providence, we
shall easily leam to persevera in prayer, and with suspended
desires to wait patiently for the Lord3 assured, though he does
not discover himself, yet that he isalways near us, and in his
own time will declara that his ears have not been deaf to those
prayers which, to human apprehension‚ seemed to be neglected.
Now, this, if God denotat any time answer our first prayers,
will be an immediate consolation, to prevent our sinlring into
despair, like those who, actuated only by their own ardour, call
upon God in such amanner‚ thatif he do not attend to their
first transports, and afford them present aid, they at once
unagine him to be displeased aud angry with them, and, casting
away all hope of succeading in their prayers, cease to call upon
him. But deferring our hope with a well-tempered equanimity,
let us rather practise the perseverance so highly recommended
to usin the Scripturas. For in the Psalmo-we may frequently
observa how David and other faithful men, when, almost
