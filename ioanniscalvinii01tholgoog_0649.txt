the dominion of one person, whether called a king, or a dulre,
or any other title3 Aristocracy, or the dominion of the priu-
cipal persons of a nati0u; and Democracy‚ or popular govem·
ment, in which the power resides irr the people at large. lt is
true that the transition is easy from monarchy to despotism;
it is not much more difficult from aristocracy to oligarchy, or
the saction of a few ; but it is most easy of all from democracy
to sedition. Indeed‚ if these three forms of government, which
are stated by philosophers, be considered in themselves, l shall
by uo means deny, that either aristocracy, or a mixture of
aristocracy and democracy, far excels all others3 and that
indeed not of itself, but because it very rarely happens that
kings regulatc themselves so that their will is never at variance
with justice and rectitude; or, in the next place, that they are
endued with such penetration and prodence, as in all cases to
discover what is best. The vice or imperfection of men there-
fore renders it safer and more tolerahle for the government to
be in the hands of many, that they may afford each other

· mutual assistance and admonition, and that it any one arrogata

to himself more than is right, the many may act as censors and
masters to restrain his ambition. This has always been proved ,
by experience, and the Lord confirmed it by his authority,
when he established a government of this kind among the
people of Israel, with a view to preserve them in the most
desirable condition, till he exhibited in David a type of Christ.
And as I readily aeknowledge that· no kind os government is
moro happy than this, where liberty is regulated with becoming
moderatiori, and properly established on a durable basis, so also
I consider those as the most happy people, who arc permitted
to enjoy such a condition 3 and if they exert their strenuous
and coustant efforts for its preservation and retention, 1 admit
that they act in perfect consistence with their duty. And to
this object the magistrates lilrewise ought to apply their greatest
diligence, that they suffer not the liberty, of which they are
constituted guardians, to be in any respect diminished, much
less to be violated: if they are inactive aud uncoucerncd about
this, they are perfidious to their office, and traitors to their
country. But if those, to whom the will of God has assigned
another sorm of government, transfer this to themselves so as
to be tempted to desire a revolution, the very thought will be
not only foolish and useless, but altogether criminal. If we
limit not our views to one city, but look round and take a
comprehensive survey of the whole world, or at least extend
our observations to distant lands, we shall certainly find it to
be a wise arrangement of Divina Providence that various coun-
tries are governed by different forms of civil polity; for they
are admirably held together with a certain inequality, as the
