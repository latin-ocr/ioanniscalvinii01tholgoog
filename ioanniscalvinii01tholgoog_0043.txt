thou me from secret faults.'’(s) This passage perfeetly ae·
corda with that before referred to, where, after having said,
“All the paths of the Lord are mercy aud tnrth unto such as
keep his eovenant aud his testimonies,'’ he adds, “For thy
name's sake, Ο Lord, pardou mine iniquity3 for it is great.” (g)
So we ought also to aehnowledge, that the Divine favour is
offered to us iu the law, if we could purchase it by our works;
but that no merit of ours can ever obtain it.

111. What, then, it will be said, were those promises given, to
vanish away without producing any effect? 1 have already
declared that this is not my opinion. lassert, indeed, that
they have no efficaey with respect to us as long as they are
referred to the merit of works3 wherefore, considered in them·
selves, they are in some sense abolished. Thus that grand
promise, “Keep my statutes and judgments3 which if a man
do, he shall live in them 3 ” (t) the apostle maintains to be of
no value to us, if we rest upon it, and that it will be no more
beneficial to us than if it had never been given; because it is
inapplicable to the holiest of God's servants, who are all far·
from fulfilling the law, andare eucompassed with a multitude of
transgressions. (i) But when these are superseded hythe evan·

to the observance of the law. l grant, therefore, that the
works of believers are rewarded by those things which the
Lord has promised in his law to the followers of righteousness
and holiness; bnt in this retributiou it is always necessary to
consider the cause, which conciliates such favour to those
works. Now, this we perceive to be tlrreefold: The fustis,
That God, averting his eyes from the actious of his servants,
which are invariably mere deserving of censure thau of praise,
receives and embraces them in Christ, aud by the intervention
of saith alone reconciles them to himself without the assistance
of works. 'I'he second is, 'I'hat iu his patemal benignity and
indulgence, he overlooks the intrinsic worth of these werke,
and exalts thern to such honour, that he esteems thern of some
degree of value. 'l'he third cause is, That he pardons these
works as he receives them, not imputing the imperfectiori with
which they are all so dcfiled, that they might otherwise be
accounted rather sins than virtues. lleuee it appears how
great has been the delusion of the sophists, who thought that
they had dexterously avoided all absurdities by saying that
works are sufficient to merit salvation, not on account of their
