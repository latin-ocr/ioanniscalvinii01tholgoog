servants for integrity and sanctity in their lives, that his good·
ness may not become an object of contempt, and that noman
infected with a vain confidence in his mercy, (p) may bless
himself in his mind while walking in the depravity of his '
heart, so he designs by these means to confine to their duty
all that arc admitted to the participation of his covenant; yet,
nevertheless, the covenant is originally constituted and perpetu·
ally remains altogether gratuitous. For this reason, David,
though he declares that he had been rewarded for the purity of
his hands, does not overlook that original source which Ι have
mentioned: “ He delivered me, because he delighted in me ς ” (q)
where he commenda the goodness of his cause, so as not to
derogate from the gratuitous mercy which precedes all the
gifts that originate from it.

VI. And here it will be useful to remark, by the way, what
difference there is between such forms of expression and the
legal promises. By legal promiseslintend not all those which
are contained in the books of Moses, -since in those books there
likewise occur many evangelical ones—but such as properly
pertain to the ministry of the law. Such promises, by what·
ever appellation they may be distinguished, proclaim that a
reward is ready to be bestowed, on condition that we perform
what is commanded. But when it is said that “the Lord
keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him‚’' this
rather designates the characters of his servants, who have faith-
fully received his covenant, than expresses the causes of his
beneficence to them. Now, this is the way to prove it: As the
Lord favours us with the hope of eternal lise, in order that he
may be loved‚ reverenced, and worshipped by us, therefore all
the promises of mercy contained in the Scriptures are justly
directed to this end, that we may revere and worship the
Author of our blessings Whenever, therefore, we hear of his
beneficence to them who observe his laws, let us remcmber that
the children of God are designated by the duty in which they
ought always to be sound; and that we are adopted as his chil-
dren, in order that we may venerate him as our Father. There·
fore, that we may not renounce the privilege of our adoption,
we ought to aim at that which is the design of our vocation.
On the other hand, however, we y be assured, that the
accomplishment of God’s mercy is ' ependent of the works
of believers; but that he fullils th ,promise of salvation to
them whose vocation is followedby a correspondent rectitude
of life, because in them who are directed by his Spirit to good
works, he recognizes the genuine characters of his children.
To this must be referred what is said of the citizens of the
