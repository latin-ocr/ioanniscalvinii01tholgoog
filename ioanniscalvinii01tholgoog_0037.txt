or of a justification unatteuded by them: thiais the sole dif-
ference, that while we aclrnowledge a necessary connection
between saith and good works, we attribute justification, net
ιο works, but to saith. Our reason for this we can readily
explain, is we only turn to Christ, towards whom saith is
directed, and from whom it receives all its virtue. Why, then,
are we justified by saith? Because by saith we apprehend the
righteousness of Christ, which isthe only medium of our re·
conciliation to God. But this you canum attain, without at the
same time attaining ιο sanctification; for he “ is made unto us
wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification arrd redemp-
tion.'' (z) Christ therefore justifies no one whom he does not
also sanctify. For these benefits are perpetually and indissolu-
bly connected, so that whom he illuminates with his wisdom,
them he redeems3 whom he redeems, he justifies; whom
he justifies, he sanctifies. But as the present question ra-
lates only ιο righteousness and sanctification, let us in·
sist upon them. We may distinguish between thern, but
Christ contains both inseparably in himself. Do you wisb,
then, to obtain righteousness iu Christ? You must first pos-
sess Christ3 but you cannot possess him without becoming a
partaker of his sanctification3 forhe cannot be divided. Since,
then, the Lord affords us the enjoymeut os these blessings only
in the bestowment of himself, he gives them both together,
and never one without the other. Thus wc see how true it is
that we are justified, not without works, yet not by worlrs3
since union with Christ, by which we are justified, contains
sanctification as well aa righteousness.

ΙΙ. Itis also exoeediugly false, that the minds of men are
aeduced from an inclination ιο virtue, by our divesting them
of all ideas of merit. Here the reader must just be informed,
that they impertinently argue from reward to merit, as l shall
afterwards more fully explain3 because, in fact, they are igno-
rant of this principle, that God is equally liberal iu assigning a
reward to good works, aa in imparting an ability to perform
them. But this 1 would rather defer ιο its proper placa-¹ lt
will suffice, at present, ιο show the wealrness of their objection,
which shall be done two ways. For, first, when they say that
there will be no concern about the proper regulation ot' our life
without a hope of reward being proposed, they altogether de·
ceive themselves. It' they only mean that men serve God in
expectatiou of a reward, and hire or sell their services to him,
they gain but little; for he will be freely worshipped and
freely loved, and he approves of that worshipper who, aster
being deprived of all hope of receiving any reward, still cesses
