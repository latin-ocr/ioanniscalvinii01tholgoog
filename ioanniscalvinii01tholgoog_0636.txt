a similar effect, and the foolish mimicry is a mere mockery of
Ohrist. 'I'hey have the effrontery, indeed, to dare to essert,
that they confer the Holy Ghost; but how sar this is true is
shown by experience, which proves, that those who arc conse·
crated priests, srom being horses become asses, and are changed

from sools to madmen. Nor do Ι contend with them on this
account; Ι only condemn the ceremony itsell, which ought
not to be made a precedent, since it was used by Christ as a
special sign of a particular miracle; so far is their pretence of
imitating him from justifying their conduct.

XXX. But from whom have they received the unctiori?
Their answcr is, that they have received it from the sons os
Aaron, from whom also their order derived its origin. 'I'hus
they always preser desending themselves by improper exam·
ples, to confessing that which they practise without just reason
to be their own invention, but at the same time, they do not
consider that, in professing themselves successore of the sons os
Aaron, they do an injury to the priesthood of Christ, which
was the only thing adumbrated and prefigured by all the an-

nacle, and of all the Jewish worship; but their religion is
still deficient in that they do not sacrifice animal victims.
Who does not see that this custom os anointing is sar more
pernicious than circumcisi0u3 especially when it is attended
with superstition and a pharisaical opinion os the merit of the
act? The Jews placed aconfideuce of righteousness in cir-
cumcision; in unctiori these men place spiritual graces. There·
lore, while they desire to be imitatore os the Levites, they
become apostates from Christ, and renounce the office os

tors.
pasXXXI. This is their consecrated oil, which, it is pretended,
impresses a character never to be effaced3 as though oil could
not be eleansed away with dust and salt, or, if it be more
adhesive, with soap. But this character, they say, is spiritual.
What connection has oil with the soul? Have they sorgotten
an observation, which they often quote to us from Augustino-
That, is the word be separated from the water, it will be
nothing but water, and that it is the word which makes ita
sacrament? What word will they show in their unctiori?
Will they produce the command which was given to Moses to
‚ anoint the sons of Aaron? But in that case there was alsoa
