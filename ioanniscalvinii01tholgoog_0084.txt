bounty should dwell, that we may all draw from it, as from a
most copious fountain, it remams for us to seels in him, and
by prayers ιο implore of him, that which we have been io·
formed resides in him. Otherwise ιο know God as the Lord
and Giver of every good, who invites us ιο supplicate him, but
neither to approach him nor to supplicate him, would be equally
unprofitable, ss for amen ιο neglect a treasure discovered to
him buried in the earth. Wherefore the apoetle, to show that
true saith cannot but be engaged in calling upon God, has laid
down this order-that, as saith is produced bytho gospel, so
by saith our hearts are brought to invoke the name of the
Lord. (z) And this is the same as he had a little before said,
that the “ Spirit of adoption,'’ who sesls the testimony of the
gospel in our hearts, encourages our spirits, so that they ven·
ture to pour out their desires before God, excite “greaniugs
that cannot be uttered,” and cry with confidence, “ Abba,
Fether.'’ (ο) This last subject, therefore, having been before
only cursorily mentioned and slightly touched, requires now to
be treated more at large.

II. By means of prayer, then, we penetrate to those richcs
which are reserved with our heavenly Father for our use.
For between God and men there is a certain communicati0u;
by which they enter into the sanctuery of heaven, and in his
immediate presence remind him of his promises, in order that
his declaratione, which they have implicitly believed, may in
time of necessity be verilied in their experience. We see,
therefore, that nothing is revealed ιο us, ιο be expected from
the Lord, for which we are not likewise enjoined to pray; so
true is it, that prayer digs out those treasures, which thc gos·
pel of the Lord discovers to our saith. NoW, the necessity and
various utility of the exercise of prayer uo language can suffi-
ciently explain. It is certainly not without reason that our
heavenly Father declares, that the only sortress of salvation
consiste in invocation of his name, by which we call to our
aid the presence of his providence, which watches over all our
concerns3 of his power, which supporta us when weak and
ready ιο faint, and of his goodness, which receives ue into
- favour, though miserably burdened with sins; in which,
finally, we call upon him to manifest his presence with us in
all his attributes. Hence our consciences derive peculiar peace
aud tranquillity3 for when the effliction which oppressed us is
represented to the Lord, we feel abundant-composure even
from this consideration—that none of our troubles are concesled
from him, whom we know ιο possess both the greatest readi-
ness aud the greatest ability to promote our truest interest.
