but makes a separate confession of his own guilt, resorting as a
suppliant to the asylum of pardon; as he expressly declares,
“ Whilst Iwas confessing my sin, and the sin of my people.” (a)
We are taught the same humility also by the example of David:
“ Enter not into judgmeut with thy servaut; for in thy sight
shall no man living be justified.'’(v) In this manner lsaiah
prays: ‘⁴ Behold, thou art wroth; for we have sinned: iu thy
ways is continuance, and we shall be saved. For we are all
as an unclean thing, and all our righteonsnesses are as filthy
rags; and we all do fade as a leaf3 and our iniquities, lilie the
wind, have taken us away. And there is none that calleth

l
because of our iniquities. But now, Ο Lord, thou art our
Father3 we are the clay, and thou our potter3 and we all are
the work of thy hand. Be not wroth very sore, O Lord, nei-
ther remember iniquity for ever, behold, see, we beseech thee,
we are all thy people.''(w) Observe, they have no depend-
ence but this; that considering themselves as God’s children,
they despair not of his future care of them. Thus Jeremiah:
“ 'I'hough our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy
name’s sake.” (a) For that is equally consistent with the
strictest truth and holiness, which was written by an uncertain
author, but is ascribed to the prophet Baruch: “A soul sorrow·
ful and desolate for the greatness of its sin, bowed down and
infirm, ahungry soul and fainting eyes give glory to thee, Ο
Lord. Not according to the righteonsnesses of our fathers do we
pour out our prayers in thy sight, and ask mercy before thy
face, O Lord, our God3 but because thou art merciful, have
mercy upon uS, for we have sinned against thee.’' (y)

IX. Finally, the commencement and even introduction to
praying rightly is a supplication for pardon with an humble and
ingenuous confession of guilt. For neither is there any hope
that even the holiest of men can obtain any blessing of God till
he be freely reconciled to him, nor is it possible for God to be
propitious to any, but those whom he pardons. It is no wonder,
then, if believers with this key open to themselves the gate
of prayer, as we learn from many places in the Psalms. For
David, when requesting another thing, says, “Remember not
the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions: according to thy
mercy remember thou me, for thy goodness' sahe,0 Lord.'’
Again: “ Look upon mine affliction and my pain, and forgive
all my sins.” (z) Where we likewise perceive, that it is not
sufficient forus to call ourselves to a daily account for recent
sins, unless we remember those which might seem to have
