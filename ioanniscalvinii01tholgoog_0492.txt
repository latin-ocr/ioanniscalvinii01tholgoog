being cast upon the shore, still terrified the Israelites with the
dreadsul sight, though they were not able to injure them, so
this enemy of ours still threatens, displays his armS, and makes

himself felt, but cannot overcome. ln the cloud there was an
emblem of ablution. For as the Lord there covered them with
a cloud, affording them resreshment, that they might not saint
and be consumed by the overpoweriug hear of the sun, so, in
baptism, we acknowledge ourselves to be covered and pro·
teeted by the blood os Christ, that the severity os God, which
is indeed an intolerable fleme, may not sall upon us. Though
this mystery was then dheodred, and known only to sew
persons, yet, as there is no other way of obtaining salvation
but by those two blessings os grace, the Lord, having adopted
the ancient fathers as his heirs, was pleased to beslow upon them
tekene os both.

X. Now, we may clearly perceive the salsehood of the notion
which some have long ago disseminated, and which others
persist in maintaining,- that by baptism we are delivered and
exempted from original sin, and stom the corruption which
hes descended from Adam to all his posterity, and are restored
to the same righteousuess and purity os nature which Adam
would have obtained is he had continued in the integrity in
which he was first created. For teachers os this kind have
never understood the nature of original sin, or original right·
eousness, or the grace os baptism. Νοττ, we have already
proved that original sin is the pravity and corruption of our
nature, which first renders us obnoxious to the wrath of God,
and then produces in us those works which the Scriptura calls
“works of the flesh.” (o) Theresore these two things are to
be distinctly observed: first, that our nature being so entirely
depraved and vitiated‚ we are, on account ol this very corrup
tion, considered as convicted and justly condemned in the
sight os God, to whom nothing is acceptable but righteousuess,
innocence, and purity. And therefore even infants themselves
bring their own condemnation into the world with them, who,
though they have uot yet produced the sruits os their iniquity,
yet have the seed of it within them; even their whole nature
is, as it were, a seed of sin, and therefore cannot but be odious
and abominable to God. By baptism, believers are certified
that this condemnation is removed from them; since, as we
said, the Lord promises us by this sign, that a full and entire re·
mission is granted both os the guilt which is to be imputed to us,
andos the punishment to be inflicted on account os that guilt;
they also receive righteousuess, such as the people os God may
obtain in this life3 that is, only by imputation, because the
Lord, in his mercy, accepts them us righteous and innocent.
