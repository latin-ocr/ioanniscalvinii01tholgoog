the world, that the principal and almost only bond 01 the unity
01 the Chureh is adherence to the 888 01 Rome, and perseve-
ranee in obedience to it. 'l'his is the foundation on which they
priucipally rest, when they wish to deny us 811 claim to the
Church, and to arrogata it to themselves ; that they retain the
head, on which the unity 81 the Church depende, and without
which it must be torn asunder and crumble to pieees. For
their notion 18, that the Church is like 8 mutilated and headless
body, unless it be subject to the Roman see as its head. 'l'here-
1818, when they dispute respectiug their hierarchy, they always
commoneo with this axiom, that the Roman pontiti, es the vicar
81 Christ, who is Head 01 the Church, presides over the universal
Chureh in his stead, and that the Church cannot be well con-
stituted, unless that see holds the primacy above all others.
Wheresore it is necessary to diseuss this subject also, that nothing
belonging to the good government of the Church maybe omitted.

11. Let the question, therefore, be stated thus: Whether it be
necessary 10 the true system 01 what they 8811 the hierarchy or
government 01 the Church, that one 888 should have the preemi-
nence above 811 the rest in dignity and power, so 88 10 be the
head 01 the whole body. Now, we subject tbe Cbureh to very
unreasouable lawe, 11 we impose this necessity upon it without
the word of God. Therefore, 11 our adversaries wish to gaiu
their cause, it is necessary 101 them, in the first place, to show
11181 11118 economy was instituted by Christ. For this purpose
they allega the high-priesthood'ordained in the law, and the
supreme jurisdiction 01 1118 high-priest which God appointed
81 Jerusalem. But it is easy to give an answer 10 this, or,
indeed, various answers, if they would not be satisfied with
one. Iu the first place, there is no reason sor extending to the
whole world what was useful inasingle nation3 on the contrary,
the case 01 8 single nation and 11181 81 the whole world are
widely different. Because 1118 Jews were surrounded on all
sides with idolaters‚ God, in order to prevent their being dis·
traeted by 8 variety 01 religions, fixed the seat 01 his worship in
the eentre 01 the country, and there he set over them one prin·
eipal priest, to whom they were all to be subject, 101 the better
preservation 81 unity among them. NoW, when the true
religion has been diffused over the whole world, who does not
perceive it to be utterly absurd to assign the government of the
east and west to one man? lt is just as 11 11 were contended,
that the whole world ought to be governed by one magistrate,
because there is only one in 8 small district. But there is
another reason why this ought not to be made a precedent 101
imitation. Every one kuows that the Jewish high-priest was

8 type of Christ: now that the priesthood has been transferred,
thet right must also be transferred. To whom, theu, 18 ittrans·
