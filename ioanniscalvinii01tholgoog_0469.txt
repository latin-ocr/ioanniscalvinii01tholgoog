as seed, is it sall on a desert and neglected spot of ground, will
die without producing any crop, but if it be cast upon a well

manured and cultivated field, it brings sorth its fruit with
au abundant increase,-so the word os God, isit sall upon
some stiff neck, will be as unproductive as seed dropped
upon the sea-shore; but if it light upon a soul cultivated by
the agency os the heavenly Spirit, it will be abundantly
sruitful. Now, is the word be justly compared to seed,-as
we say that from seed, corn grows, increases, and comes to ma·
turity, -why may we not say that saith derives its commence-
ment, increase, and perfectiori, from the word of God? Paul,
iu different places, excellently expresses both these things.
For, with a view to recall to the recollectiou of the Corinthi-
ans with what efficacy God had attended his labours, he glo·
ries iu having the ministry of the Spirit, as if there were an
indissoluble connection between his preaching and the power
os the Holy Spirit operating to the illumination os their minds,
aud the excitement os their hearts. (r) But in another place,
with aview to apprize them how sar the power of the word os God
extends, merely as preached by man, he compares ministers to
husbandmen 3 who, when they have employed their labour and
industry iu cultivating the ground, have nothing more that
they can do. But what would ploughing, and sowing, and
watering, avail, unless heavenly goodncss caused the seed to
vegetare? Therefore he concludes, “ Neither is he that plaut-
eth any thing, neither he that watereth; but God, that giveth
the increase.'' (s) 'l'he apostles, theu, in their preaching, ex-
erted the power of the Spirit, as sar as God made uscos the
instrumente appointed by himself sor the exhibition of his
spiritual grace. But we must always keep iu view this distinc-
tion, that we may remember how sar the power os man extends,
and what is exclusively the work os God.

Xll. Now, it is so true that the sacramente are confirmations
os our saith, that sometimes, when the Lord intends to take
away the confidence of those things which had been promised
in the sacraments, he removes the sacramenta themselves.
When he deprived Adam of the gift os immortality, he ex-
pelled him from the garden os Eden, sayiug, “Lest he put
forth his hand, and take also os the tree os lise, and eat, and
live for ever.’' (t) What can be the meaning os this language?
Could the fruit restore to Adam the incorruption srom which
he had now salleni Certainly not. But it was the same as
is the Lord had said, Lest he should cherish a vain confidence,
is he retain the symbol os my promise, let him be deprived of
that which might give him some hope os immortality. For
