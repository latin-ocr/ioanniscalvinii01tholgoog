lish a law for anniversary fasts, but only once, while he was

preparing to enter on the promulgation of the gospel. Nor did
he fast in the manner of men, as it behoved him to do, if he
intended to stimulate men to an imitation of him: on the con-
trary, he exhibited an example calculated to attract the admira·
tion of all, rather than to excite them to a desire of emulating
his example. In short, there was no other reason for his fast-
ing than for that of Moses, when he received the law from the
hand of the Lord. For as that miracle was exhibited in Mo-
ses, to establish the authority of the law, it was necessary that
it should nothe omitted in Christ, lest the gospel should seem
to be inferior to the law. But from that time, it never entered
into any man’s mind to introduce such a form of fasting among
the people of lsrael, under the pretext of imitating Moses; nor
was it followed by any of the holy prophets and father‘s, not·
withstanding their inclination and zeal for all pious exercises.
For the account of Elijah, that he lived forty days without
meat and drink, was only intended to teach the people that
he was raised up to be the restorer of the law, from which
almost all Israel had departed. lt was nothing but a vain and
superstitious affectation, therefore, to dignify the fasting of
Lent with the title and pretext of an imitation of Christ. In
the manner of fasting, however, there was at that time a great
diversity, as Cassiodorus relates from Socrates, in the ninth
book of his history. “For the Romans,” he says, ‘¹ had no
more than three weeks; but during these there was a continual
fast, except on the Sunday and Saturday. The lllyrians and
Greelrs had six weeks, and others had seven; but they fasted
at intervals. Nor did they differ less as to the nature of their
food. Some made use of nothing but bread and water; others
added vegetables to fish ς some did not abstain from fowl 3
others made no distinction at all between any lrinds of food.''
This diversity is also mentioned by Augustine, in his second
epistle to Januarius.

XXI. The times which followed were still worse; to the
preposterous zeal of the multitude was added the ignorance
and stupidity of the bishops, with their lust of dominion and
tyrannioal rigour. lmpious laws were enaeted to bind men’s
consciences with fatal chains. The eating of animal food was
interdicted, as though it would contaminate them. Sacrile-
gious opinions were added one after another, till they arrived
at an ocean of errors. And that no corruption might be omit·
ted, they have begnn to trifle with God by the most ridiculous
pretensions to abstinenee. Potin the midst of all the most
exquisite delicaoies, they seek the praise of fasting; no dain·
ties are then sufficient ; they never have food in greater plenty,
or variety, or deliciousness. Such splendid provision they call
