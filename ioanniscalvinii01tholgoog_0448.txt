great cheerfulness. At the close of the day, while yet fasting,
every one comes forth from bis cell, and they all assemble to
hear the Father3 and each of these Fathers is surrounded by
at least three thousand men,’' (he is speaking chiefly of Egypt
and the East 3) “ there they take some bodily refreshment, as
much as is sufficient for lise and health3 every one restraining
his appetite that he may make but a sparing use even of the
provisions placed before him, which are in small quantities, and
of the plainest description. That they not only abstain from
animal food and from wine, in order to repress libidinous
desim, but from such things as stimulate the appetite with
greater power, in proportion to the opinion entertained by
some persons of their purity, under which pretence a vile
longing after exquisite meats, with the exception of animal
food, is wont to be ridiculously and shamefully defended.
Whatever remains beyond their necessary food, (and the sur·
plus is considerable, both from the diligence of their hands,
and from the abstemiousness of their meals,) is distributed
to the poor, with greater care than if it had been earned by
those who distribute it. For they are not anxious to have
an abundance of these things, but all their concern is, that none
of their abundance may remain with them.” Afterwards,
having mentioned their austerity, of whrch he had seen exam-
ples at Milan and other places, he says, “ln these circum-
stances, no one is urged to austerities which he is unable to
bear; there is no imposition on any one, of that which he re-

himself too weak to imitate them; for they remember the high

pure, all things are pure. (i) Therefore all their industry is
exerted, not in rejecting certain kinds of food as polluted, but in
subduing concupiscence and preserving the love of the brethren.
They remember that it is said, Meats for the belly, and tha
belly for meats; but God shall destroy both it and them. (lc)
Yet many strong persons abstain on account of the weak.
Many have a different reason for doing it; they are fond of
living on meaner and less sumptuous food. These persons,

therefore, who are abstemious when in perfect health, if astate ‚

of indisposition requires, partake, without any sear, when they
are sick. Many drink no wine3 but this is not from an appre-
hension of being defiled with it; for they most humanely cause
it to be given to those who are languid, and cannot obtain
health of body without it; and some, who soolishly resuse it,
they admonish, with brotherly affection, to beware lest their
vain superstition debilitate them rather than promote their holi-
