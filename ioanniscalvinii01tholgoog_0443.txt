it is very evident what dreadful punishments the Lord generally
inflicts on such arrogance, sels-conlidence‚ and contempt of
his gifts. Modesty forbids me to animadvert on those things
'which are more secret, of which too much is already known.
Thet we are not at liberty to vow any thing which may hindar
us from serving God in our vocation, is beyond all controversy3
as if a father of a family should vow that he will desert his
wife and children, to undertake some other charge; oras if a
person qualified to fill the ollice of magistrate, on being chosen
to it, should vow that he would remain in a private station.
But the observation we have made, that our liberty ought not
to be despised‚ has some difficulty, which requires a further
explication. Now, the meaning may be briefly explained in
the following manner: As God has constituted us lords os all
things, and has placed them in subjection to us, in order that
we might use them all for our accommodation, we have no
reason to hope that we should perform a service acceptable to
God, by making ourselves slaves to external things, which
ought to be subservient to our assistance. I say this, because
some persons consider themselves entitled to the praise of
humility‚ if they entangle themselves with many observances,
from which the Lord, for the best os reasons, intended we should
be exempt. 'Pherefore if we would escape this danger, let us
always remember, that we are never to depart from that econo-
my which the Lord has instituted in the Christian Chnrch.

IV. lproceed now to the third consideration which 1 men·
tioned3 that it is of great importance with what intentione
vow is made, it we wish it to be approved by God. For as
the Lord regards the beart, and not the external appearance, it
happens that the same action, performed with different designa,
is sometimes acceptable to him, and sometimes highly displeas·
ing. lf any one vow abstinence from wine, as if there were
any holiness in such abstinenee, be is chargeable with supersti-
tion; if thisbe done for any other end which is not improper,
no one can disapprove of it. Now, as faras 1 arn able to jndge‚
there are four ends to which our vows may be rightly directed.
For the sake of further elucidation, I refer two of thern to the
time past, and the other two to the future. 'Po the tirne past
belong those vows by which we either testify our gratitude to
God for benefits received, or, in order to deprecate his wrath, in·
flict punishment on ourselves for sins that we have committed.
'Phe former may be called vows of thanksgiving3 the latter,
vows of penitence. Of the former we have an example in
Jacob, who vowed to give to God the tenth of all he should
acquire, if the Lord would bring him again from his exile to
bis father’s house in peace. (g) We have other examples of
