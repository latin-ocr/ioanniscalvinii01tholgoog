acceptable 101110 sight 01 God, who will have all meu 10 be
saved ; '’ which only imports, that God has not closed the way
01 salvation against any order 01 0100, but has diffused his
mercy in such a manner that he would have no rank to be des·
tituta 01 11. The other texts adduced are not declarativa 01 the
Lord’s determination respectiug all meu 10 his secret counsel:
they only proclaim that pardon is ready 101 011 0100010 who
sincerely seelr it. (q) For 11 they obstinately insist 011 110 being
said that God is 0101011111 toall, I will oppose to thern, what is
elsewhere asserted, that “our God is in the heavens3 he hath
done whatsoever he hath pleased.'' (r) This text, then, must
be explained in a manner consistent with another, where God
says, “I will be gracious to whomlwill be gracious, and Ι will
show mercy ou whom l will show mercy.’' (s) He who makes
a selection 01 objects 1011110 exercise 01 1110 mercy, does not
impart that mercy to all. But as it clearly appears that Paul is
there speaking, not 01 individuale, but orders 01 men,1 shall
forbear any further argument. Ι1 must be remarked, however,
that Paul is not declaring the actual conduct 01 God at all 1111100,
10 all places, and to all persons, but merely representing him as
at liberty to make kiugs aud magistrates 01 length partalrers 01
’ the heavenly doctrine, notwithstanding their present rage against
it in consequence 01 their blindness. There is more apparent
plausibility iu their objection, from the declaration 01 Ρο101,
that “the Lord 10 001 willing that any should perish, but that
all should corne to repentance.’' (1) But the second clause
ι 1010101100 an immediate solution 01 this difficulty3 1011110 will·
ingness that they should corne to repentance must be understood
in consistence with the general tenor os Scriptura. Conversiou
lacertainly in the power 01 God; let him be asked, whether
he wills the conversion 01 all, when he promises a few indi·
viduals to give them “a heart 01 flesh,” while he leaves others
with “a heart 0101000.”(11) 11 he were 001 ready to receive
those who implore his mercy, there would indeed be 00 propri·
ety iu this address, “ Turn ye unto me, and l will turn unto
you 3 ” (a) but Ι maintain that no mortal ever approaches God
without being divinely drawn. But 11 repentance depended 00
1110 will 01 1000, Paul would not have said, “Is God peradven·
ture will give thern repentance.'’ (y) And 11 God, whose voice
exhorts all men to repentance, did not draw the elect to it by
the secret operation 01 1110 Spirit, Jeremiah would not have said,
“ Turn thou me, and 1 shall be turned3 101 thou art the Lord
my God. Stuely 01101 that I was turned, l repented.” (z)
