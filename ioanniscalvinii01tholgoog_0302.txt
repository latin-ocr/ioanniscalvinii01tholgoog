the most lawless and ferocions handitti in the world. Every
thing in it is clearly so dissimilar and repugnant to the
institution of Christ, so degenerated from the ancient regu·
lations and usages of the Church, so at variance with na-·
ture and reason, that no greater injury can hedone to Christ,
than by pleading his name in defence of such a disorderly
government. We (they say) are the pillars of the Chnrch, the
prelatas of religion, the vicars of Christ, tha heads of the faith-
ful, because we have succeeded to the power and authority of
the apostles. They are perpetually vaunting of these fooleries,
as if they ware talking to bloohs of wood; but whenever they
repeat these hoasts,l will ask them in return, what they have in
common with the apostles. For the question is not respect-
ing any hereditary honour, which may be given to men while
they are asleep, but os the office of preaching, which they so
carefully avoid. So, when we essert that their kingdom is the
tyranny of Antichrist, they immediately reply, that it is that
venerable hierarchy, which has been so osten commended by
great and holy men. As though the holy fathers, when they
praised the ecclesiastical hierarchy, or spiritual government‚ as
it had been delivered to them by the hands of the apostles,
ever dreamed of this chaos of deformity and desolation, where
the bishops for the most part are illiterata asses, unacquainted
with the first and plainest rudimenta of the saith, or, in some
instauees, are children just ont of leading-strings3 and if anybe

things ere confonnded with a dispersion worse than that of
Babel, so that there ean no longer be seen any clear vestiga of

XIV. Whatif we procaed to inquire into their manners?
“Where is that light of the world,’' which Christ requires?
where that “salt of the earth? '’ (m) where that sanctity, which
might serve as a perpetual example to others? There is no
class of men in the present day more infamous for profusion,
delicacy, luxury, and profligacy of every kind; no class of
men contains more apt or expert masters of every species of
imposture, fraud, treachery, and perfidy3 nowhere can be found
equal cunning or audacity in the commission of crime. 1 say
nothing of their pride, haughtiness, rapacity, and cruelty3 1
