and, if these follow baptism, Ι have established what lwish.
But, leaving all subterfuges, let us adhere to the simple in·
terpretation which Ihave proposed-that no one, till he is
renewed by living water, that is, by the Spirit, can enter into
the kingdom of God.

XXVI. Itis further evident that their notion ought to be
exploded, because it adjudges all nnbaptized persons to eternal
death. Let us suppose their tenet to be admitted, and baptism
to be administered to adults alone; what will they say will
become of a youth who is rightly instnrcted in the first princi·
ples of piety, if he desircs to be baptized, but, contrary to the
expectation of all around, happens to be snatched away by sud·
den death? The Lord’s promise is clear: ‘⁴ Whosoeverbeliev-
eth on the Son, shall not come into condemnation ; ’³ but “is
passed from death unto life.” (ro) We are nowhere informed
of his having condemned one who had yet not been baptized.
By this Ι would not be understood as implying that baptism
may be despised with impunity3 for, so far from attempting to
excuse such contempt, l affirm it to be a violation of the
covenant of the Lord; l only mean to evinco that it is not so
necessary, as that a person, who is deprived of the opportuni·
ty of embracing it, must immediately be considered aa lost.
But it we assent to their notion, we shall condemn all, without
exception, whom any circumstance whatever prevents from
being baptized‚ whatever saith they may otherwise have, even
that saith by which Christ himself is enjoyed. Moreover, they
sentence all infants to eternal death, by denying thern baptism,
which, according to their own confession, is necessary to
salvation. Let them see, now, how well they agree with the
language of Christ, which adjudges the kingdom of heaven to
little children. But though we should grant them every thing
they contend for relative to the sense of this passage, still they
will gain no advantage from it, unless they first overturn the
doctrine which we have already established respecting the re-
generation of infanta. ,

xxvll. But the strongest argument of all in favour of their
opinion, they boast, is contained in the original institution of
baptism, which they quote from the last chapter of MattheW,
where Christ, sending forth his disciples to all natious‚ gave
them a commission, first to teach, and then to baptizo. “Co
ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them iu the name
of the Father, aud of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teach·
ing them to observe all things whatsoever l have commanded
you.” (a) Then, from the last chapter of Mark, they add,
“ He that believeth and is baptized shall be saved.’' (y)
What more do wc require, say they, when the language of our
