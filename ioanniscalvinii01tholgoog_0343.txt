removed the Church from Jerusalem to Pella What we are
informed did happeu once, may have happened oftener. There·
, fore to attach the honour of the primacy to any particular place,
so that he who is in fact the most inveterate enemy of Christ,
the greatest adversary of the gospel, the desolater and destroyer
of the Church, the most cruel murderer and butcher of all the
saints, must nevertheless be accounted the vicar of Christ, the
successoros Peter, the chief prolate of the Church, merely be·
cause he occupies what was anciently the first see, is a thing
extremely ridiculous and absurd. l sorbeat to remark the irn-
mense difference between the pope's chancery, and a well re·
gulated administration of the Church; though this one thing
is sufficient to remove every difficulty on this subject. For no
man in his sound senses will include the episcopal office in lead
and in bulls, much less in that school of frauds and chicaneries, in
which the pope’s spiritual government consists. lt has justly
been remarked, therefore, that the Roman Church which is
boasted of, has long ago been converted into a secular court,
which is all that is now to he seen at Rome. Nor am 1 here
accusing the vices of individuals, but proving that the Papaoy
itself is diametrically opposite to the legitimate order of the
Church.

xxvtt. But if we proceed to persons, it is well lrnown
what kind of men we shall find sustaining the character of
victus of Christ. Julius, and leo, and Clamant, and Paul,
will be pillars of the Christian saith, and the principal oracles
of religion, who never knew any thing of Christ, except what
they had learned in the school of Lucian. But why do I enu-
merate three or four pontific, as though it were doubtful what
kind of religion the pontiffs and the whole college of cardinale
have professed long ago, and profess in the present day? For
of the secret theology which prevails among them, the first
article is, that there is no God; the second, that all that is
written and preached concerning Jesus Christ is falsehood
and imposture; the third, that the doctrine ofa futuro lise,
and that of the final resurrection, are mere fables. This opin-
ion,1 confess, is not entertained by all, and is expressed by
few of them3 yet it long ago began to be the ordinary religion
of the pontifis. Though this is notorious to all who are ac·
quainted with Rome, yet the Roman theologians persist in
boasting that the possibility of error in the pope has been pre·
vented by the privilege of Christ, because he said to Peter,
“l have prayed for thee, that thy saith fail not.'' (c) What
can they gain by such impudent mockery, except it be to con·
vince the whole world of their having arrived at such an

(ι) cue rut. aa.
