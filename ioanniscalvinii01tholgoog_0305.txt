Therefore I am not inclined to spend my words in vain. But
Iask‚ if any Jew were to abuse these passages in the same
manner, what reply would they make to him? 'I'here is uo
doubt but they would reprove his stupidity, in transfenIng to
the flesh and the world things which are spiritually spoken of
the spiritual kingdom of the Messiah. For we know that,
under the image of earthly things, the prophets have repre·
sented to us the heavenly glory of God, which ought to shine iu
the Church. For of those external blessings which their words
express, the Church never had less abundancc than in the days of
the apostles ; and yet it is acknowledged by all that the kingdom
of Christ, then flourished in its greatest vigour. What, then, it
will be asked, is the meaning of these passages? Ireply, that
every thing precions, high, and excellent, ought to be iu subjec-
tion to the Lord. ln regard to the express declaration, that kings
shall submit their sceptres to Christ, cast theIr crowns at his feet,
and consecrate their wealtb to the Church, when (they will say)
was it more truly and fully exemplified, than when Theodosius,
casting off the purple robes, and relinquishing the eusigns of
imperial rnajesty, submitted himself, like one of the common
people, to do solemn penance before God and the Chureh? thau
when he and other such pious princes devoted their cares arrd
exertions to the preservation of pure doctrine in the Church,
and to the support and protection of sound teachers? But
how far the priests of that age were from ri0ting in superfluous
riches, a single expression of the Council of Aquileia, at which
Ambrose presidcd, sufficieutly declares. “Poverty is horiour·
able in the priests of the Lord.'' It is true that the bishops at
that time had some wealth, which they might have employed
to display the honour of the Church, if they had considered
thern as the Church's real ornaments. But knowing that there
was nothing more inconsistent with the office of pastore, than
to display and to pride themselves on the luxury of their tables,
the splendour of their apparel, a large retinue, and magnificent
palaoes, they followed aud maintained the humility and rno-
desty, and even the poverty which Christ has consecrated in
all his ministers.

XVIII. But not to dwell too long on this point, let us again
collect into a brief summmy, how very much the present dis·
pensation, or rather dissipation, of the property of the Church,
differs from that true office of deacons, which the word of God
commeuds to us, arrd which the ancient Church observed.
That portion which is employed in the ornaments of temples, 1
assert, is grossly misapplied, if it be not regulated by that
moderatiori which the nature of sacred things requires, and
which the apostles and holy fathers have prescribed both by
precept and by examples. But what is thera seen like this, in
