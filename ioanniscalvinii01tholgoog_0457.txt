XVIII. But they still pursue the argument, and endeavour
to show that vows os this kind were in use in the times of the
apostles ; because Paul says that widows who, after having
been recalved into the public service of the church, married,
had “cast off their first faith.'' (ro) lde not deny that widows
who dedIcated themselves and their services to the Ohurch,
thereby entered into a tacit obligation never to marry again;
not because they placed any religion iu such abstinence, as
began to be the case afterwards3 but because they could not
discharge that office without being at their own disposal, free
from the restraint of marriage. But if, after having pledged
their saith, they contemplated a second marriage, what was
this but renouncing the calling of God? It is no wonder,
therefore, if he says that with such desires “they wax wauton
against Christ.’' Afterwards, by way of amplification, he sub-
onns, that they failed of performing what they had promised
to the Church, so that they even violated and annulled their
first saith pledged in baptism; which includes au engagement
from every one to fulfil the duties of his callIng. Unless it be
thought better to understand the meaning to be, that having,
as it were, lost all shame, they would theuceforward have no
longer any regard for virtue, but would abandon themselves to
every kind of profligacy, and in a licentious and dissolute life
exhibit the greatest contrariety to the characteres Christian
women -an interpretation thch 1 much approve. We reply,
therefore, that those widows, who were then recered into the
service of the Churcb, imposed on themselves the condition of
perpetual widowhood; if they afterwards married, we easily
understand their situation to have been as Paul states, that,
casting off shame, they betrayed an insolence unbecoming
Christian women 3 and that thus they not only sinned In break-
ing their saith pledged to the Ohurch, but in departing from
the common obligations of pious females. But first, 1 deny
that they engaged to remain ina state of widowhood for any
other reason than because marriage would be altogether incom-
patible with the office which they undertoolr3 or that they
bound themselves to widowhood at all, except as far as the
necessity of their vocation should require. Secoudly, I do not
admit that their profession was so bindIng, but that even then
it was better for them to marry than to be inflamed with con·
cupisccnce, or to be guilty of any impurity of conduct. Thirdly,

Iobserve that Paul prescribes that age which is generally be· ’

yond all danger, forbidding any to be received under threescore
