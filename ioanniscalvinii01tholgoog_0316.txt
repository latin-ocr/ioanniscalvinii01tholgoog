city must preside over the whole world? By what right do
they restrict toene place this dignity, which was conferred
without the mention of any place? Peter, they say, lived
and died at Rome. What shall we say of Christ himself?
Was it not at Jerusalem that he exercised the office of a bishop
while he lived, and fullilled the priestly office by his death?
'I'he Prince of pastors, the supreme Bishop, the Head of the
Churnh, could not obtain this honour for the place where he
lived and died; how then could Peter, who was far inferior to
him? Are not these follies worse than puerile? Christ gave
the honour of primacy to Peter; Peter settled at Rome3 there·
fore he fixed the seat of the primacy in that city. For the
saure reason the ancient Israelites ought to have fixed the *seat
of their primacy iu the desert, because it was there that Moses,
their chief toacher, and the prince of their prophete, exercised
his ministry, and died.

XII. Let us see how wretchedly they reason. Peter, they
say, had the preeminence among the apostles. 'Pherefore‚
the Ghurch in which he settled ought to have this privilege.
But where was he first stationed? They reply, at Antioch.
Thau 1 infer that the Church os Antioch is justly entitled te
the primacy. They confess that it was originally the first,
but allega that Peter, on his removal from it, transferred the
honour which was attached to him to Rome. For there is an
epistle of Pope Marcellus to the presbyters of Antioch, in which
he says, “The see of Peter was at first among you, but at the
command of the Lord was afterwards removed to this city.”
So the Church of Antioch, which was originally the first, has
given place to the see of Rome. But l ask, By what oracle
did that wisc pope know that the Lord had commanded this?
For if this cause is to be decided on the footing of right, it is
necessary for thern to answer, whether this privilege be per·
sonal, or real, or mixed. lt must be one os these. lf they
affirm it to be personal, then ithae nothing to do with the
place. If they allega it to bc real, then when it has once
been given to a place, it cannot be taken away from it by
the death or removal of the person. It remains, therefore,
for thern to declare it to be mixed3 and then it will not
be sufficiently simple to consider the place, unless there be au
agreement also with respect to the person. Let them choose

' which they will, 1 shall immediately conclude, and will easily

prove, that the assumptiones the primacy by the see of Rome
is without any foundation.

Xlll. Let us suppose the case, however, that the primacy
was, as they pretend, transferred from Antioch to Rome. Why
did not Antioch retain the second place? For, if Rome has
the pre'e‘minence of all other sees, because Peter presided there
