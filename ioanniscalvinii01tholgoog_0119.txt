undertaking independently of his will, and without invohing his
aid. And since it has already been several times observed, that
he is justly honoured when he is acknowledged to be the
Author of all blessings, it thence follows that they should all
be so received from his hand, as to be attended with unceasing
thanksgiving3 and that there is no other proper method of
using the benefits which flow to us from his goodness, but by
continual acknowledgmeuts of his praise, and unocasing expres·
sions of onr gratitudo. For Paul, when he declares that they are
“ sanctified by the word of God and prayer,” at the same time
implies, that they are not at all holy and pure to us without
the word and prayer; (s l the word being metonymically used
to denote saith. Wherefore David, aster experiencing the good·
ness of the Lord, beantifnlly declares, “He hath pnt a new
song in my mouth ; ’' (g) in which he certainly implies that we
are guilty of a criminal silence, if we omit to praise him for
any benefit3 since, in every blessing he bestows on us, he gives
us additional cause to bless his name. Thus also Isaiah, pro·
claiming the unparalleled grace os God, exhorta believers to a
new and uncommon song. (Ιι) In which sense David elsewhere
says, “O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall show
forth thy praisa.” (ι’) Hezekiah likewise,.and Jonah, declaro
that the end of their deliverance shall be to sing the Divino
goodness in tho temple. (lc) David prescribes the same general
rule for all the saints. “What shall I render (says he) unto the
Lord for all his benefits towards mel 1 will take the cup of
salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.'’ (l) And this
is followed by the Church in another psalm: “Save us,0
Lord our God, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to tri·
umph in thy praise.'' (m) Again: “He will regard the prayer
of the destitute, and not despise their prayer. 'l'his shall be
written for the generation to come; and the people which
shall be created shall praise the Lord. Το declare the name
of the Lord in Zion, and his praise in Jerusalem.'’ (ιι) More·
over, whenever believers entreat the Lord to do any thing
“for his name's sake,'' as they profess themselves unworthy
to obtain any blessing on their own account, so they lay them-
selves under au obligation to thanksgiving3 and promise that
the Divine beneficence shall be productiva os this proper effect
on them, even to cause them to celebrate its fame. Thus
Hosea, speaking of the future redemption of the Church, ad-
dresses the Lord: “Take away all iniquity, and receive us
gracionsly3 so will we render the calvos of our lips.’' (o) Nor

do the Divina blessings only claim the praises of the tongue,
