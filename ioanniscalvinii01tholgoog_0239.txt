uncertainty, of which no one can sasely despise the authority,
or reject the admonitione, or resist the counsels, or slight the
censuras, much less separate from it and break up its unity.
For so highly does the Lord csteem the communion of his
Church, that he considers every one as a traitor and apostate
from religion, who perversely withdraws himself from any
Christian society which preserves the true ministry of the word
and sacramenta He commenda the authority of the Church,
in such amanncr as to account every violation of itan infringe-
ment of his own. For it is not a trivial circumstance, that the
Ohurch is called “the house of God, the pillar and ground of
truth.” (q) For in these words Paul signifies that in order to
keep the tmth of God from being lost in the world, the Church
is its faithful guardian3 because it has been the will of God,
by the ministry of the Ohurch, to preserve the pure preaching
of his word, and to manifest himself es our affectionate Father,
while he nourishes us with spiritual fond, and provides all
things conducive to our salvation. Nor is it small praise, that
the Ohurch is chosen and separated by Christ to be his sponse,
“not having spot or wrinlrle,¹' (r) to be “his body, the sulness
of him that filleth all in all.'' (s) Hence it follows, that a
departure from the Ohnrch is a renunciation of God and Christ.
And such a criminal dissension is so much the more to be
avoided, because, while we endeavour, as far as lies in our
power, to destroy the tmth of God, we deservo to be crushed
with the most powerful thunders of his wrath. Nor is it
· possible to imagine a more atrocious crime, than that sacrile-
gious perfidy, which violares the conjugal relation that the
only begotten Sonos God has condescended to form with us.
XI. Let us, therefore, diligently retain those characters im·
pressed upon our minds, and estimate them according to the
judgment of God. For there is nothing that Satan labours
more to accomplish,than to remove and destroy one or both of
them; atone time to efface and obliterate these marks, and so
to talre away all true and genuine distinction of the Church3 at
another to inspire us with contemptos them, and so to drive
us out of the Church by an open separation. By his subtlety
it has happened, that in some ages the pure preaching os the
word has altogether disappeared; and in the present day he is
labouring with the same malignity to overturn the ministry;
which, however, Christ has ordained in his Chureh, so that if it
were taken away, the edification of the Church would be quite
at au end. How dangerous, then, how fatal is the temptation,
when it even enters into the heart of aman to withdraw him-
self from that congregation, in which he discovers those signs
