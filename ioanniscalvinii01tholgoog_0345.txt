Now, is a judgment is to be formed on their conduct, let the
pontiffs answer sor themselves in what part ot' it they can at

all be recognized es bishops. ln the first place, the mods os
lise generally pursued at Rome, not only without any opposi-
tion srom them, but with their connivance, and even tacit np-
prohation, is altogether disgrecesul to bishops, whose duty it
is to restrain the licentiousness oi the people bys rigid dis·
cipline. 1 will not, however, be so severe against them ea
to charge them with the saults of other persons. But while
both themselves and their familias, with almost the whole
college os cardinale, and the whole host ot* their clergy, are so
abandoned to all kinds os debauchery, impurity, and obscenity,
arrd to every species of enormity and crime, thet they resemble
monsters rather than men, they prove themselves to heve uo
just claim to the character os bishops. 'l'hey need not be
afraid, however, thet l shall proceed to a further dicolosure of
their turpitude. For it is unpleasent to meddle with such
abominabis pollution, and it is necessary to spere cheste ears.
Resides, l conceive, 1 hare more then sufficieudy proved what
1 intended, that even is Rome hed auciently been the head
of all Chumhes, yet et the present dsy she is not worthy oi
being accounted one of the smallest toes of the Church’s leet.
XXX. With respect to the cardinale, as they ere called, 1
know not how it hes corne to poss that they heve so suddenly
risen to such high diguity. ln the time of Gregory, this title
vas exclusively applied to bishops; sor whenerer he mentions
ostdinals, he speaks oi them not only as belonging to tbe cumen
ol* Rome, but to any otber Churches; so thet, in short, cardinal
giges is no other thm ebishop. lhnd no meh title at all in
writers of any preceding uge; eud st that time, l observo,
they were sar inferior to bishope, to whom they ore now so
far superior. 'Phia passage os Augustino is well known:
‘⁸ Though, according⁴ to the titles os honour which have long
been used in the Ohurch, a bishop is superior toa presbyter,
yet Augustino isin many things inferior to Jerome.'’ He
clearly makes not the least distinction between a presbyter oi
the Roman Chtuch and those os other Chutches, but places
uam all alike below the bishops. And this order was so long
observed, that in the Council os Carthago, when two legates
stteuded from the Roman see, onea bishop, tlte other a pres·
hllflh the presbyter was obliged to take the lowest seat. But
not to go too ser into antiquity sor exemplos, we have the acts
oi e council bold under Gregory at Rome, et which the pres·
byters set in the lowest place, and subscribed separately3 and
tue domnus were not allowed to subscribo at all. und, indeed,
the prlests had no other office at that time, than to attend and
essist the bishop in the ministry os the word and the adminis-
