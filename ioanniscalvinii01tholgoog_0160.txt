causes of electioni A subsequant clausa seems further to con·
firm what he had said- “ according to his good pleasure, which
he purposed in himself.” (l) For the assertion, that God pur·
posed in himself, is equivalcnt to saying, that ha considered
nothing out of himself, with any view to influenca his deter-
mination. Therefore he immediately subjoins, that the great
and only object of our electionis, “that we should be to the
praise of '' Divino “ grace.'’ Certainly the grace of God de·
serves not the sole praise of our election, unless this election ba
gratuitous Now, it could not be gratuitous, if, in choosing his
people, God himself considered what would be the nature of
their respective works. The declaration of Ohn'st to his dis·
ciples‚ therefore, is universally applicable to all believers:
“ Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you; '' (m) which
not only excludes past merita, but signifies that they had nothing
in themselves to cause their electiori, independently of his pra·
venting mercy. This also is the meaning of that passage of
Paul, “ Who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed
unto him again?” (a) For his design is to show, that God’s
goodness altogether anticipates men, finding nothing in them,
either past or· future, to conciliate his favour towards them.

IV. ln the Epistle to the Romans, where ha goes to the
bottom of this argument, and pursues it more at length, he says,
“They are not all Israel which are ’' born “ os lsrael; ’' (o) be·
cause though all ware blessed by hereditary right, yet the suc·
cession did not pass to all alihe. This controversy originated
in the pride andvain·glorying of the Jewish people, who, claim·
ing for themselves the title of the Church, would make thc
faith of the gospel to depend on their decision; just as, in
the present day, the Papists with this false pretext would sub·
stitute themselves in tha place of God. Paul, though he admits
the posterity of Abraham to ba holy in consequence of the
covenaut, yet contenda that most of tham are strangers to
it; and that not only because they degenerare, from legitimate
children becoming spurious ones, but because the preeminence
and sovereignty belong to God’s special electiori, which is the
sole foundation of the validity of their adoption. If some wera
established in the hope of salvation by their own picty, and the
rejection of others were owing wholly to their own defection,
Paul’s reference of his readers to the secret electiori would indeed
be weak and absurd. Now, if the will of God, of which no
cause appears or must be sought out os himself, discriminatos
some from others, so that the children of lsrael are not all true
Israelites, it is in vain pretended that the condition of every
individual originatea with himself. He pursues tha subject fur·
