liver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor ; and do no
wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the
widow, neither shed innocent blood.”(y) To the same pur·
pose is the exhortation in the eighty-second psalm: “ Defend
the poor and fatherless: do justice to the affiicted and needy:
deliver the poor and needy: rid thern out of the hand of the
wicked.’' (z) And Moses “charged the judges” whom he
appointed to supply his place, saying, “Hear the causes
between your brethren, and judge righteously between every
man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him: ye
shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear the
small as well as the great3 ye shall not be afraid of the face
of man; for the judgment is God’s.’' (a) Ι forbear to remark
the directions given by him in another place respecting their
future kings: “He shall not multiply horses to himself ;
neither shall he greatly multiply to himself silver and gold;
his heart shall not be lifted up above his brethren; he shall
read in the law all the days of his life ; ” (ὁ) also that judges
show no partiality, nor take bribes, with similar injunctions,
which abeund in the Scriptures3 because, in describing the
office of magistrates in this treatise, my desigrr is not so much
to instruct magistrates themselves, as to show to others what
magistrates are, and for what end God has appointed them.
We see, therefore, that they are constituted the protectore and
vindicatore of the public innocence, modesty, probity, and
tranquillity, whose sole object it ought to be to promote the
common peace and security of all. Of these virtues, David
declares that he will be an example, when he shall be exalted
to the royal throne. “1 will set no wichad thing before mine
eyes. l will not lmow 3 wiclred person. Whoso privily
slandereth his neighbom, him will l cut off : him that heth a
high loolr and a proud heart will I not suffer. Mine eyes shall
be upon the faithftd of the land, that they may dwell with me:
he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall serve me.’' (c) But
as they cannot do this, unless they defend good men from the
injuriosos the wicked, and aid the oppressed by their relief
and protection, they are likewise armed with power for the
suppression of crimes und the severe punishment of malefac-
tors, whose wickedness disturbs the public peace. For expe-
rience fully verifies the observationes Solon: “ That all states
are supported by reward and punishment ; and that when these
two things are removed, all the discipline of human societies is
brolren and destroyed.’' For the minds of many lose their re-
gard for equity and justice, unless virtue be rewarded with due
