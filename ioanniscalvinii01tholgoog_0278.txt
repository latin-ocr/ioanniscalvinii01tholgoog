appointing the new magistrates, for no other reason but because
he received the suffrages and presided at the election. Surely
it is not credible that Paul granted to Timothy and Titus more
power than he assumed to himself; but we see that he was accus·
tomed to ordain bishops according to the suffrages of the people.
The above passages, therefore, ought to be understood in the
same manner, to guard against all infringement of the common
right and liberty of the Church. It is a good remark, therefore,
of Cyprian, when he contenda, “ that it proceeds from Divina
authority, that a priest should be elected publicly in the presence
of all the people, and that he should be approved as a worthy
and fit person by the public judgment and testimony.'' In the
case 01 118 Levitical priests, we find it was commanded by the
Lord, that they should be brought forward in the view of the
people before their consecration. Nor was Matthias added to
the number of the apostles, nor were the seven deacons appoint-
ed, without the presence and approbation of the people.-
“These examples,’' says cyprian, “show that the ordination
of a priest ought not 10 18 performed but with the knowledge
and concurrence of the people, in order that the election
which shall bavc been examined by the testimony 01 811, may
be just and legitimate.” We find, therefore, that it is a legiti-
mate ministry according to the word of God, when those who
appear suitable persons are appointed with the consent and ap·
probation of the people; but that other pastore ought to preside
over the election, to guard the multitude from falling into any
improprieties, through inconstancy, intrigue, 01 confusion.

NoW, it appears that when the apostles introduced any one into
the ministry, they used no other ceremony than imposition of
hands. This rite, 1 believe, descended from the custom of the
Hebrews, who, when they wished to bless and consecrate any
thing, presented it 10 God by imposition of hands. Thus, when
Jacob blessed Ephraim andManasseh, he laid his hands upon their
heads. (a) This custom was followed by our Lord, when he
prayed 0181 infanta. (y) It was with 118 same design, Ι appre-
heud, that the Jews were directed in the law 10 lay their hands
upon their sacrifices. Wherefore the imposition of the hands '
of the apostles was an indication that they offered to God the
person whom they introduced into the ministry. They used
the same ceremony over those 011 whom they conferred the
visible gifts 01 118 Spirit. But, be that as it may, this was

the solemn rite invariably practised, whcnever any oue was
called to the ministry of the Church. Thus they ordained
