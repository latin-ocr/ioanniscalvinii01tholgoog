when they rnean to describe it, represent us merely as parta·

lrers of his Spirit, but make no mention 01 his flesh and blood;
as though there were unmeaning in these and other similar
expressions: “ 'Phat his fiesh is meat indeed3 that his blood is
drink indeed ; that except we eat his flesh, and drink his blood,
we have no life in us.” Wherefore, 11 11 be evident that the
11111 communion 01 Christ goes beyond their too confined de-
scription 01 11, 1 will endeavour to state, in few words, how far
it extends, before 1 speah 01 the contrary error 01 carrying it to
excess. For Ι shall have a longer controversy with the hyper-
bolieal doctors, who, while in their folly they imagine an absurd
and extravagant way 01 eating the flesh 01 Christ, and drinking
his blood, deprive him 01 his real body, and metamorphose
him into a mere phantom; if, however, it be possible, in any
words, to unfold so great a mystery, which l find myself inca-
pable 01 properly comprehending, even 111 my mind 3 and this
lam ready to acknowledge, that 110 person may measure the
sublimity 01 the subject by my irradequate representation 01 it.
On the contrary, l exhort my readers not to confine theirthoughts
within such narrow and insufficient limits, but to endeavour 10 rise
much higher than I am able to conduct them3 for as to myself,
whenever I handle this subject, 01101 having endeavoured to say
every thing, 1 am conscious 01 having said but very little, in
eomparlson 01 its excellence. And though the conceptions 01
the mind 0011 101 exceed the expressions 01 the tongue, yet,
with the magnitude 011110 subject, 1110 mind itself is oppressed
and overwhelmed. Nothing remains 101 1110, therefore, butte
brealr forth in admiration of that mystery, which the mind is
unable clearly to understand, or the tongue to express. 1 will
nevertheless state the substance 01 my opinion, which, as 1
have 110 doubt 01 113 1111111, I trust will also be received with
approbation by godly minds.

Vlll. 1111110 first place, we learu from the Scripturas, that
Christ was 110111 the beginning that life-giving Word 01 1110
Father, the fountain and origin 01 1110, frorn which all things
have ever derived their existence. Therefore John in one
place calls him “Tho Word 01 1110,” aud 111 another says, that
“in him was 1110 ; ” (111) signifying, that even then he diffused
his energy over all the creaturos, and endued them with life
and breath. Yet the same apostle immediately adds, that
“the 1110 was manifested '' then, and 1101 before, when the Son
01 God, by assuming our flesh, rendered himself visible to the
eyes, and palpable to the hands 01 men. For though he dif-
fused his infiuenee over all the 0100111103 before that period,
yet, because man was alienated 110111 God by sin, had lost the
