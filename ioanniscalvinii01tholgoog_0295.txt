of creating presbytera, they say, belongs exclusively to them.
But this isa gross corruption os the ancient institution; sor
by their ordination they create, not presbyterato rule and seed
the people, but priests to offer sacrifice. So when they conse·
crate deacons, they have nothing to do with their true and
proper office, but only ordain them to certain ceremonias about
the chalice and patine. In the Council of Chalcedon, on the
contrary, it was decreed, that there should be no absolute or· ·
dinations, that is, without some place being at the same time
assigned to the persons ordained, where they were to exercise
their office. This decree was highly uscsul, for two reasons-
first, that the Churches might not be burdened with an unne-
cessary charge, and the money which ought to be distributed to
the poor consumed upon idle men ; secondly, that the persons or·
dained might consider themselves not as promoted to an honour,
butas intrusted with an office to the discharge of which they
were bound by asolemn engagement. But the Romish doctors,
who think their belly ought to be all their care, even in matters
os religion, first explain the requisita title to consist in an income
sufficient sor their support, whether arising from their own pa·
trimony or from a benefice. Thercsore, when they ordain a
deacon or a presbyter, without giving themselves any concern
where he is to officiata, they readily admit him, if he be only
rich enough to maintain himself. But who can admit this, that
the title which the decree of the council requires ia a competent
annual income? And because the more recent canons con-
demned the bishops to maintaiu those whom they had ordained
without a sufficient title, in order to prevent their too great fa-
cility in the admissiou of candidates, they have even contrived a
way to evade this penalty. For the person ordained mentions
any title whatever, and promises that he will be content with it.
By this engagement he is debarrcd from an action for main-
tenance. 1 say nothing of a thousand frauds practised in this
business; as when some falsely exhibit empty titles of bene-
fices, from which they could not derive five pence a year;
others, under a secret stipulation, borrow beneficas which they
promise to return immediately, but which, in many instances,
are never returned; and other similar mysteries.

V. But even thou'gh these grosser abuscs were removed, is
it not always absurd to ordain a presbyter without assigning
him any station? For they ordain no one, but to offer- sacri·
fice. Now, the legitimate ordination os a presbyter consists in
a call to the governmeut os the Church, and that os a deacon
to the collection os the alms. 'l'hey adorn their procedure, in·
daed, with many pompous ceremonias, that its appearance may
gain the veneration of the simple; but with judicious persons,

what can be gained by those appearances unaccompanied by
