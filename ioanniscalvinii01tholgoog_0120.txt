but naturally conciliate our love. “ 1 love the Lord (says David)
because he hath heard my voice and my supplications.’⁷ (p) In
another place also, enumerating the assistances he had expe·
rieuced, “I will love thee, Ο Lord, my strength.” (q) Nor
will any praises ever please God, but such as flow from this
ardour of love. We must likewise remember the position of
Paul, that all petitions, to which thanksgiving is not annexed,
are irregular and faulty. For thus he speaks: “ In every thing
by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests
be made known unto God.’' (r) Por since morosaness, weari-
ness, impatience, pungent sorrow· and fear, impel many tc
mutter petitions, he enjoins such a regulation of the affections,
that believers may cheerfully bless God, even before they have
obtained their requests. If this connection ought to exist
in circumstances apparently adverse, God lays us under a still
more sacred obligation to sing his praises‚ whenever he grants
us the enjoyment of our wishes. But as we have asserted that
our prayers, which had otherwise been defiled, are consecrated
by the intercession of Christ, sothe apostle, when he exhorts
us “by Christ to offer the sacrifice of praise,''(s) admonishes
us that our lips are not sufficiently pure to celebrate the name
of God, without the intervention of the priesthood of Christ.
Whence we infer, how prodigious must be the fascination of
the Papists, the majority of whom wonder that Christ is called
an Advocate. This is the reason why Paul directs to “ pray
without ceasing,’' and “in every thing to give thanks;’' (t)
because he desires that all men, with all possible assiduity, at
every time and in every place, and in all circumstances and
affairs, may direct their prayers to God, expecting all from him,
and ascribing to him the praise of all, since he affords us
perpetual matter of prayer and praise.

XXIX. But this diligenco in prayer, although it chiefly
respecta the particular and private devotioris of each individual,
has, notwithstanding, some reference also to the public prayers
of the Church. But these cannot be unceasing, nor ought they
to be conducted otherwise than according to the polity which is
appointed by the common consent. This, indeed, Ι confess.
For therefore also certain hours are fixed and prescribed, though
indifferent with God, yet necessary to the customs of men, that
the benefit of all nray be regarded, and all the affairs of the
Church be administered, according to the direction of Paul,
“decently and in order.’' (a) But this by no means prevents .
it from being the duty of every Church often to stimulate them·
selves to a greater frequency of prayer, and also to be inflamed
