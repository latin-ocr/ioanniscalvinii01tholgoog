not simply malre the disciples ocular witnesses of his ascension,
with a vlew to preclude every doubt; just as if they had said,
Reeeived up into heaven in your sight, he has taken possession
of the celestial empne, it remaius for you to wait with pa-
tience till he shall come again as the judge of the world; for
he is now entered into heaven, not to occupy it alone, but 10
assemble you and all 1110 godly to enjoy it with him.

XXVIII. As the advocates of this spurious doctrine are not
ashamed to defend it by the suffrages of 1110 fathers, and parti-
eularly of Augvistine,l will briefly expose the disingenuousuess
01 11110 attempt. Their testimonias having been collected by
learned and pious writers, I have no inclination to go over the
same ground 3 any one who wishes may consult their writIngs.
Nor even from Augustino shall I adduce every passage which
would serve 1110 argument; but shall content myself with
showing, by a few extracts, that he is, beyond all doubt, per·
fectly in harmony with us. In order to deprive us of him, our
adversanes allega that, in various parts of his works, he states
the flesh and blood of Christ, even the vietim once 01101011 011
1110 01000, 10 110 dispensed in the sacred supper; but this is alto·
gether frivolous3 since he also calls the consecrated symbols
either “the eucharist,'' or ‘¹ the sacrament 01 Christ’s body and
blood.” But in what sense he uses 1110 words flesfv and blood, it
is unnecessary to make any long or circuitous inquiry; 101 110
explains himself by saying, “that sacramenta take their names
from the similitude of those things which they signify, and,
therefore, 111 001110 001100, the sacrament 01 the body 10 the body.''
With this corresponds another well known passage: “ The
Lord hesitated 1101 10 say, This is my body, when he delivered
the sign 01 11.” 'I'hey object again, that Augustius expressly
says, that the body 01 Christ falls to the earth, and enters into
the mouth. Ireply, that he says this in the same sense in
which he affirms it 10 be consumed ; because he connects both
these things together. Nor does any objection arise from his
saying, that when the mystery is finished, the bread 100011-
sumed; because he had just before said, “As these things are
known to man, being done hymen, they may have honour as
holy things, but not as miracles.'’ And 10 1110 same effect is
another expression, which our adversaries, without sufficient
consideration, represent asin their favour ; that, “when Christ
presented the mystical bread to his disciples, he, in a certain
sense, held himself in his own hands.” For, by Introducing this
qualifying phrase io 0 certain sense, he sufficiently declares that
the body 01 Christ was not truly or really enclosed in the breed.
Nor ought this to be thought strange, for ln another place 110
expressly malntains, “ That if bodies ba deprived of their local
spacas, they will be nowhere, and consequently will cease to
