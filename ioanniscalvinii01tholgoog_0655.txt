precept or example, which proves war to be lawsul to Chris·
tiana, l answcr, first, that the reason sor wagiag war which
existed in ancient times, is equally valid iu the present age3
and that, on the contrary, there is no cause to prevent princes
from desending their subjeets. Secondly, that no express de·
claration on this subject is to be expected in the writings os the
apostles‚ whose design was, not to organize civil governments,
but to describe the spiritual kingdom cf Christ. Lastly, that
in those very writings it is implied by the way, that no change
has been made in this respect by the coming of Christ. “ For,”
to ase the words cf augustine, “if Christian discipline con·
demned all wars, tlie soldiers who inquired respecting their
salvation ought rather to bave been directed tc cast away their
’ arms, and entirely to rencunce the military profession; where·
as the advice given them was, ‘Do violence to nc man, neither
accuse any salsely3 and be content with your weges.¹ (w) An
injunction to be content with their weges was certainly not a '
prohibition of the military lise.’' But here all magistrates
ought to be very cautious, that they follow not iu any respect
the impulse os their pessicns. On the contrary, is punish·
ments are to bc inflicted, they ought not to be precipitated
with anger, exasperated with hatred, or inflamed with implaca-
ble severity: they ought, as Angustiae says, “ to commiserate
cur common nature even in him whom they punish sor his
crime.'’ Or, it anns are tc be resorted to against an enemy, that
is, au armed robber, they ought not to seiae a trivial occasion,
nor even tc take it when presented, unless they are driven to
it by extreme necessity. For, is it be our duty to exceed what
was required by that heathen writer who maintained that the
evident object os war ought to be the restoration oi peace, cer·
tainly we ought to make every other attempt before we have
recourse to the decision os arms. In short, in both cases they
must not suffer themselves to be carried away by any private
motive, but be wholly guided by public spirit; otherwise they
grossly abuse their power, which is given them, not scr their
own particular advantage, but sor the benefit and service os
others. Moreover, on this right oi war depende the lawfulness
of garrisons, alliances, and other civil munitione. By garri·
amaa, I mean soldiers who are stationed in towns to defend the
boundaries oi a country. By alliances, l mean confederatione
which are made between neighbouring princes, that, is any dis·
turbance arise in their territorias, they will render each other
mutual assistance, and will unite their forces together sor the
common resistance os the common enemies os mankind. By
ciciynmnitipns, 1 mean all the provisions which are employed
1nt eartc war.
