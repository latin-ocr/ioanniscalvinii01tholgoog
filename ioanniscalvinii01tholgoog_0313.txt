upon him among the Gentiles, than upon Peter among the
Jews; and lastly, that when Peter acted with some degree of
unfaithsulness, he was reproved by him, and stood corrected
by the reproof(m) All these things fully prove, either that
there was an equality between Paul and Peter, or at least that
Peter had no more power over the rest than they had over him.
And this, as I have already observed, is the professed object of
Paul -to prevent his being considered as inferior in his apos·
tolic character to Peter or John, who were his colleagues, not
his masters.

VIII. But though I grant them what they require respecting
Peter, by admitting that he was the chief of the apostles,and
superior in dignity to all the others, yet there is no reason why
they should convert a particular instance into a universal rule,
and make what was done but once a perpetual precedent; for
the cases are widely different. 'I'here was oue chief among
the apostles3 doubtless because they were few in number. 11*
there be one president over twelve men, will it therefore follow
that there ought to be but one president over a hundred thou·
saud men? 'I'hat twelve should have one among them to
preside over the rest, is no wonder. For this is consistent
with nature, and the common sense of mankind requires, that
in every assembly, even though they are all equal in power,
yet there should be one to act as moderator, by whom the
others should be regulated. There is no court, council, parlia-
ment, or assembly of any description, which has not its presi·
dent or chairman. So there would be no absurdity, if we
acknowledged that the apostles gave this preeminence tc Peter.
But that which obtains among a small company is not imme·
diately to be applied to the whole world, to the governmeut of
which no one man is sufficient. But the whole economy of
nature, they say, reaches us, that there ought to be one su·
preme head over all. And in proof of this they adduce the
example of cranes and bees, which always choose for them-
selves one leader, and no more. I admit the examples which

they produce3 but do bees collect together from all parts of .

the world to choose one king? Each king is content with his
own hive. So, among cranes, every flock has its own leader.
What will they prove from thie, but that every Ohurch ought
to have its own bishopl Next they call usto consider exam·
ples from civil govemments. They quote an observation from
Homer, that it is not good to have many govemors, with simi·
lar passages os other profane writers in commendation of monar-
chy. 'Phe answer is easy3 for monarchy is not praised by
Ulysses in Homer, or by any others, from an opinion that one
