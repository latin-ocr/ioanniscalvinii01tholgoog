reference to true saith. The second we explain to signisy true
saith, than which he calls charity greater, not as being more
meritoribus, but because it is more sruitsul, more extensive,
more generally serviceable, and perpetual in its duratiou;
whereas the use os saith is only temporary. ln respect os ex·
cellense, the preie'minence must be given to the love os God,
which is not in this place the subject os Paul's discourse. For
the only point which he urges is, that with reciprocal charity
we mutually edisy one another in the Lord. But let us suppose
that charity excels saith in all respects, yet what person pos-
sessed os sound judgment, or even os the common exercise os
reason, would argue srom this that it hasa greater concern in
justificationi The power os justisying, attached to saith, con·
sists not in the worthiness os the act. Our justification depende
solcly on the mercy os God and the merit os Christ, which
when saith apprehends, it is said to justisy us. Now, is we ask
our adversaries in what sense they attribute justification to
charity, they will reply, that because it is a duty pleasing to
God, the merit os it, being accepted by the Divine goodness, is
imputed to us sor righteousness. Herc we see how curicusly
their argument proceeds, We assert that saith justifies, not by
procuring us a righteousness through its own merit, but as
the instrument by which we sreely obtain the righteousness os
Christ. These men, passing over in silence the mercy os God,
and making no mention os Christ, in whom is the substance os
righteousness, contend that we are justified by the virtue os
charity, because it is more excellent than saith; just as though
any one should insist that a king, in consequence os his superior
rank, is more expert at making a shoe than a shoemaker. This
one argument assords an ample proos that all the Serbonie
schools are destitute os the least experience os justification by
saith. But isany wrangler should yet inquire, why we un·
derstand Paul to nse the wordsaitlt indifferent acceptations in
the same discourse, I am prepared with a substantial reason sor
such an interpretation. For since those gists which Paul enu-
meratas, are in sorno respect connected with saith and hope,
because they relate to the knowledge os God, he summarily
comprises them all under those two words; as though hc had
said, 'Phe end os prophecy‚ and os tongues, os knowledge, and os
the gift os interpretation, is to conduct us to the knowledge os
God. But we know God in this lise only by hope and saith.
Theresore, when 1 mention saith and hope, l comprehend all
these things under them. “And now abideth saith, hope,
charity, these three ; ’' that is, all gista whatever may be their
variety, are referred to these. “But the greatest os these is
charity.'’ From the third passage they inser, that if “charity
isthe bond os persectness,'’ it is therefore the bond os right·
