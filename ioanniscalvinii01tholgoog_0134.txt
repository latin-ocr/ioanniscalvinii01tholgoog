Afterwards, it is our duty to descend to the impious, by whom
his authority is resisted with the perseverance of obstinacy and
the fury ot' despair. God therefore erecte his kingdom nn the
humiliation ol the whole world, though his methods of bumili-
ation ara various3 sor be restrains the passions of some, and
breaks the nnsubdued arrogance ot* others. lt ought to be the
object of our daily wishes, that God would collect cburches sor
himself from all the countries os the earth, that he would en-
large their numbers, enrich them with gists, and establish a
legitimate order among them; that, on the contrary, he would
overthrow all the enemies of the pura doctrine and religion,
that he would confound their counsels, aud deleat their at·
tempts. Whence it appears that the desire ot' a daily progrese
is not enjoined us in vain ; became human affairs ara nevar in
such a happy situation, as that all defilemant ot' sin is removed,
and purity can be seen in full perlection. This perfectionis
deserred till the last advent of Christ, when, the apostle says,
“God will be all in all.''(l) And so this petition ought to
withdraw us from all the corruptions of the world, which sepa·
rate us from God, and prevent his kingdom from flourishing
within us; it ought likewise to indame us with an ardent
desire of mortifying the flesh, and finally to teach usto bear

the cross; since these are the means which God chooses for ’

the extension ol his kingdom. Nor should we be impatient
that the nutward man is destroyed, provided the inward man
be reuewed. For this is tlre order os the kingdom of God,
that, when we submit to his righteousness, he makes us par·
takers os bis glory. This is accomplished, when, discovering
his light and truth with perpetual accession ot' splendonr,
before which the shades and falsehoods of Satan andos his
kingdom vanish and become extinct, be by the aids of his
Spirit directs his children into the path of rectitudo, and
strengthens them to perseverance; but deleats the impious
etlinspigacies of his enemies, consounds theidinSidious ang fraud·
uturt lucraturum,‚tentaremur
the spirit of his mouth, and destroy'’ all impiety “with tha
brightness ot' his coming.” (m)
