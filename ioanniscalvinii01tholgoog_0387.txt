descended from the apostles; and they contend that one exam·
ple sufficiently shows what was the conductos the apostles in
other cases3 when, being assembled together in a council, they
determined and announced to all Gentiles, that they should
“ abstain from ments offered to idols, and from blood, and srorn
things strangled.'’ (m) We have already exposed the salsehood
of their pretensions in arrogating to themselves the title cf the
Church. With regard to the present argument, if, stripping off
all false disguises, wc confine our attention to what ought to
be our chief concern, and involves our highest interests, nnmely,
what kind os aChurch Christ requires, in order that we may
conform ourselves to its standard-it will be sufficiently evi·
dent to us, that the name of the Chnrch does not belong to
those who overleap all the limits of the word os God, and exer-
cise an unbounded license ol enecting new laws. For does
not that law, which was once given to the Ghurch, remain sor-
ever in force? “What thing soever I command you, observe
to do it: thou shalt not add thereto, nor diminish from it.” (n)
And again: “Add not thou unte his words, lest he reprove
thee, and thou be found a liar.”(o) Since they cannot deny
these things to have been spoken to thc Church, do they not
declare the rebellion of the Ohurch, when they pretend that,
notwithstanding such prohibitions, it has dared to mingle ad·
ditione of its own with the doctrine of God? Far be it from
us, however, to countenance their salsehoods, by which they
do so great an injury to the Charch3 let us know that the as·-
sumptiones the name ol the Ohurch is a salse pretence in all
who are so carried away by the violence os human presumption, ,
as to disregard all the restraints os the word of God, and to in·
troduce a torrent ol' their own inventione. There is nothing
involved, nothing intricate, nothing ambiguous in these words,
by which the whole Ohurch is forbidden to add any thing to
the word, or to diminish any thing from it, in any question re-
lating to the worship os God and his salutery precepta But it
will be alleged, that this was spoken exclusively os the law,
which has been succeeded by the propheciae and the whole
dispensation os the gospel. This Ι certainly admit, and at the
same time essert, that these were accomplishments of the law,
rather than additions to it, or retrenchments of it. But il the
Lord suffered no enlargement or diminution os the ministry ol
ldoses, notwithstanding it was enveloped in such great ob·
scurity, till hc dispensed a clearer doctrine by his servants the
prophete, and finally by his beloved Son, -why do not we con-

sider ourselves sar more severely prohibited from making any
addition to the law, the propoets, the psalma, and the gospel?
