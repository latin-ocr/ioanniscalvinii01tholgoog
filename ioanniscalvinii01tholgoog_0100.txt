and 1 will answer him: Ι will be with him in trouble: 1 will
deliver him.’' (g) As l have before said, however, my design
is not to enurnerate all the texts, but to select the most remark·
able, from which we may perceive the condescending kindness
of God in inviting usto him, and the circumstances of ag·
gravation attending our ingratitude‚ while our indolence still
lingers in the midst of such powerful incitaments. Wherefore
let these words perpetually resound in our ears: “The Lord is
nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him
in nuth, '' (lt) as well as those which we have cited from Isaiah
and Joel; in which God affirms, that he is inclined to hear
prayers‚ and is delighted, as with a sacrifice of a sweet savem,
when we cast our cares upon him. We derive this singular
benefit from the Divina promises, when our prayers are con·
ccivcd without doubt or trepidation3 but in reliance on his word,
whose majesty would otherwise terrify uS, we venture to call
upon him as our Father, because he deigns to suggest tous
this most delightful appellation. Favoured with such invita-
tions, it remains for us to know that they fumish us with suffi-
cient arguments to enforce our petitions3 since our prayers
rest on no intrinsic merit; but 811 their worthinesS, as well as
all our hope of obtaining our requests, is founded in, and de-
pendent upon, the Divine promises; so that there is no need of
any other support or further anxiety. 'Pherefore wc may be
· fully assured, that though we cqual not the sanctity so cele·
brated in holy patriarchs, propheta, and apostles, yet, since the
command to pray is common to us as well asto them, and we
are partakers of the same common faith, if we rely on the Di·
vine word, we are associated with them in this privilege. For
God's declaration, (already noticed,) that he will be gentle and
merciful to all, gives all, even the most miserable, 8 hope of
obtaining the objects of their supplications3 and therefore we
should remark the general forms of expression, by which no man,
from the greatest to the least, is excluded 3 only let him possess
sincerity of beart, sels-abhorrencc, humility, and faith; and
lct not our hypocrisy profane the name of God by a pretended
invocation of him3 our most merciful Father will not reject
those whorn he exhorts to approach him, 8ηά even urges by
evcry possible mode of solicitation. Hence the argument of
David’s prayer, just recited: “ Thou, Ο Lord, hast revcaled to
thy servant—3 therefore hath thy servant found in his heart to
pray this prayer unto thee. And n0W‚ Ο Lord God, thou art
that God, 8ηά thy words be true, and thou hast promised this
goodness unto thy servant : ’² begin therefore and do it. (i) As
also in another place: “ Lat thy kindness be according to thy
