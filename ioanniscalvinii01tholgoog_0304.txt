lished. 'Phe prinoipal part of this plunder was seized by the bish-
ops and the presbytera of citios, who, being enriched by it, were
converted into canons. 'l'hat the partition was made in confu-
sion is evident from the contentions which prevail among them,
even to this day, about their respective limits. But, however
it may be managed, they have taken care that not a penny of
all the property of the Ghurch should reach the poor, who
were at least entitled to half of it. For the canons expressly
allot them one fourth part, and assign another fourth part to the
bishops‚ to be laid out in hospitality and other offices of charity.
l say nothing of what tho clergy ought to do with their portion,
and to what use they ought to apply it. 'Phe residue, which is
appropriated to the reparation of temples‚ edifices, and other ex·
perressit has been sufficiently shown, ought to be at the service
of the poorintime of necessity. If they hadasingle spark of the
sear of God in their hearts, could they bear this reflection of
conscience, that every thing they eat,and drink‚ and wear, is
the fruit of robbery, and even ofsacrilsgc? But though they are
little affected with the judgment of God, they should at least
consider that those, whom they wish to persuade into a belief
of their possession of such an excellent and well regulated
system in their Ohurch as they are accustomed to boast, are
men eudued with sense and reason. Let them answer me, in a
word, whether desconship be a linense for theft and robbery?
If they deny this, they will also be obliged to confess, that they
have no such office left3 seeing that among them tho whole
administration of the ravenues of the Ohurch hasbeen openly
perverted into a system of sacrilegious depredation.

XVII. But here they advance a most plausible plea They
allege that the dignity of the Church is beoomingly sustaiued
by this magnificence. And such is tho impudence of some of
their fection, that they dare to boast in express terms, that this
priucely state of the priesthood constitutes the only fulfilmont
of those predictious iu which the ancient prophete describe the
splendour of the kingdom of Christ. It is not in vain, they
