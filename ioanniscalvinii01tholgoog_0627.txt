in the Scriptores 101 the Holy Spirit and his gifts to be signi-
fied by oil. But that grace of healing has disappeared, like
all the other miraculous powers, which the Lord was plcased
10 exhibit 101 a time, that he might render the preaching of the
gospcl, which was then new, the object of admiration for ever.
Even though we should fully grant, therefore, that unction
was a sacrament of the powers which were administered by
the instrumentality of the apostles, it has nothing to do with
us, to whom the administrationes those powers has not been
committed.

XIX. And what greater reason have they to make a sacra·
ment of this unctiori than of all the other signs or symbols
which are mentioned in the Scriptores? Why do not they
appoint some pool 01 Siloam, in which the sick may bathe
themselves at certain seasons?(c) That, they say, would be
avain attempt. Surely not more in vain than unctiori. Why
do they not “ fall upon and embrace '’ 1110 dead, because Paul
resuscitated a deceased young man by such means ? (d) Why
is not clay, composed of spittle and dust, converted into a
sacrament? All tha others, they say, were single examples,
but the use of unction is commanded by Jarnes. 1 reply, that
James was speaking in reference to that period iu which this
benediction 01 God was still enjoyed by 1110 Church. They
affirm, indeed, that there is even now the same virtue in their
unctiori, but we find it 10 be otherwise by experience. 1101 110
0110 now wonder how they have so confidently deluded souls,
whom they know 10 be stupid and blind when deprived 01 the
word 01 God, which is their life and light, since they are not at
all ashamed to attempt to deceive the living and observing sauses
os the body. They make themselves ridiculous, therefore,
when they boast that they are endued with the gift 01 healing.
'l'he Lord is undoubtedly present with his people 10 assist
them in ali ages; and, whenever it is necessary, he heals their
diseases as much as he did in ancient times; but he does not
display those visible powers, 01 dispensa miracles by the hands
01 apostles; because that gift was only 01 temporary duration,
and was soon lost, in some measure, by the ingratitudo of men.

XX. As the apostles, therefore, had sufficient cause for
using the symbol 01 011 as arr evident testimony that the gift
of healirrg, which had been committed to thern, was not a
power of their own, but of the Holy Spirit, s0, on the other
hand, they do a great irrjury to the Holy Spirit who represent
a fetid 011, destitute of all efficacy, as his power. 'l'his is just
as if any one were to affirm, that all 011 10 the power of the
Holy Spirit, because it is called by that name in the Scriptum
