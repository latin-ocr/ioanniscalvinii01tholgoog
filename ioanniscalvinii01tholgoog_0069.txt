Divine will. But the mle os judging os unrighteousness is very
different. For he who has committed fomication or thest,is
for one transgression liahle to the sentence of death, because he
has offended against the divine Majesty. 'l'hese disputants of

But especially it is arr appendix to justification, and affords uo

their millerias, because in the spiritual intoxication with which
they are selred, they allow themselves the most unbounded
impudence. Wheresore this is the proper time to introduce the
subject; and though we have slightly touched upon it on some
former occasions, yet it was useful ιο defer the full discussion
of it to this place 3 because, as soon as any mention is made of
Christian liberty, then either inordinate passions rage, or violent
emotions arisc, unless timely opposition be made to those
wauton spirits, who most nefariously corrupt things which are
otherwise the best. For some, under the pretext of this liberty,
