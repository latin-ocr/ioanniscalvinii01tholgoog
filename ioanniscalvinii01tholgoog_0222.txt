though we must maintain what we have asserted, and what
is asserted by Paul in his celebrated confession before Felix,
“that there shall be a resurrection of the dead, both of the just
and unjust,'’ (a) yet the Scriptura more commonly exhibita the
resurrection to the children of God alone, in connection with the
glory of heaven3 because, strictly speaking, Christ will come,
not for the destruction of the world, but for purposes of salva·
tion. This is the reason that the Creed mentions only the life
of blessedness. ,

victory,” shall then, and not till then, be fully accomplished, -

smallest part of itpwould scarcely be mergitioned. Fo'r though
we are plainly informed‚ that the kingdom of God is full of
light, joy, felicity, and glory‚ yet all that is mentioned remains
far above our comprehension, and enveloped, as it were, in
enigmatical obscurity, till the arrival of that day, when he shall
exhibit his glory to us face to face. “Now are we the sons of
God, (says John) and it doth not yet appear what we shall be3
but we know, that when he shall appear, we shall be like
him ; for we shall see him as he is.” (ὁ) Wherefore the
propheta, because they could not describe that spiritual bless-
edness by any terms expressive of its sublime nature, generally
represented it under corporeal images. Yet, as any intimation
of that happiness must kindle in us a fervour of desire, let us
chiefly dwell on this reflection-lf God, as an inexhaustible
fountain, contains within himself a plenitude of all blessings,
nothing beyond him can ever be desired by those who aspira
to the supreme good, and a perfectiori of happiness. This we
are taught in various passages of Scriptura. “ Abraham,'' says
God, “l am thy exceeding great reward.''(c) With this
David agrees: “ The Lord is the portion of mine inheritance;
the linesare fallen unto me in pleasant places.''(d) Again:
“1 will behold thy face, l shall be satisfied.'' (e) Peter de·
clares, that believers are called, “ that they might be partakers
of the Divine nature.’'(s) How will this be? Because “he
shall be glorified in his saints, and admired in all them that
believe.'’ (g) If the Lord will make the elect partakers of his
glory‚ strength, and righteousness, and will even bestow him·
self upon thern to be enjoyed, and, what is better than this, to
be in some sense united to them,-let us remember, that in
this farorrr every kind of felicity is comprised. And after we
