are undone; nothing awaits us but ruin, confusion, and despair.
Though we strive with all our powers, we shall gain nothing,
at last, but a discovery that we are most unworthy, after hav-
ing laboured to the utmost to find some worthiness. Το heal
this wound‚ they have contrived a method of attaining worthi-
ness3 which is, that having, as far as we cau, examined our
consciences, and required from ourselves an account of all our
actions, we should purge ourselves from our unworthiness by
contrition‚ confession, and satisfaction; but what kind os pur-
gation this is, we have already stated in a place more suitable
to the discussion of it. As far as relates to the present subject,
Iobserve that these consolations are too poor and unsubstan·
tial sor consciences disturbed, distressed, dejected, and over·
whelmed with a sense of their sins. For if the Lord, by his
express interdiction, admits none to a participation of the sup
per, but those who are righteous and innocent, it requires no
little cara in any individual to attaiu an asstrrance of his pos·
sessiones that righteousness, which he finds to be required by
God. Now, what ground of assurance have we, that God is
satisfied with persons who have done what they could? And
evenis this were the case, when shall any man be found who
can venture to declara that he has done all that he could?
Thus, while no certain assurance of our worthiness can be
obtained, the entrance to the sacrament will always remain
closed by that drendsul interdiction, which denounces that
“he that cateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth aud drinketh
judgment to himself.”

XLII. Now, it is easy to judge what kind of doctrine this is
which prevails in the Papacy, and from what author it has pro·
ceeded; which by its extreme austerity deprivesand robs mise·
*table sinuers, who are already afflicted with trepidation and
sorrow, of the consolation of this sacrament, in which all the
comforts of the gospel wera set before them. It was certainly
impossible for the devil to take a more compendious method
of ruining men, than by infatuating them in such a manner
as to deprive themoi all teste and relish for such food which
their heavenly and most merciful Father had intended for their
nourishment. That we may not precipitate ourselves into this
abyss, therefore, let us remember that this sacred banquet is
medicine to the siclt, comfort to the sinnar, alrns to the poor,
but that it would confer no advantage on the healthy, the
righteous, arrd the rich, if any such could be found. For as
Christ is given to us in it for food, we understand, that with·
out him we pine, starve, and faint, as the body loses its vigour
from want of sustenance. Moreover, aa he is given to us for
life, we understand that without him we are utterly dead in
· ourselves. Wherefore the best and only worthiness that we
