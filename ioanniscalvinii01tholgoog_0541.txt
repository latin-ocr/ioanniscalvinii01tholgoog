· pending death, it was necessary to his recovery of any hope of

immortality, that he should be received into the communion
of that word. For what slender hopes shall we form, if we
hear that the Word of God contains in himself all the pleni·
tude of life, while we are at an infinite distance from him,
and, withersoever we turn our eyes, see nothing but death
presenting itself on every side? But since he who is the
fountain of life has taken up his residence in our flesh, he
remains no longer concealed at a distance from us, but openly
exhibits himself to our participation. He also makes the very
flesh in which he resides the means of giving life to us, that,
by a participatior] of it, we may be nourished to immortality.
“I arn the living bread,’' says he, “which came down from
heaven. And the breed that 1 will give is my flesh, which 1
will give for the lif —of the world.‘'(n) ln these words, he
shows, not only that he is life, as he is the eternal Word who
descended from heaven to ns, but that iu descending he impart-
ed that power to the flesh which he assumed, in order that
it might communicate life to us. Hence follow these declara·
tions: “ That his flesh is meat indeed, and that his blood is
drink indeed ;'’ (o) meat and drink by which believers are
nourished to eternal life. Here, then, we enjoy peculiar conso-
lation, that we find life in our own flesh. For in this manner
we not only have an easy access to it, but it freely discovers
and offers itself to our acceptance; we have only to open our
hearts to its reception, and we shall obtain it.

IX. Now, though the power of giving life to us is not an
essential attribute of the body of Christ, which, in its original
condition, was subject to mortality, and now lives by an irn-
mortality not its own, yet it is justly represented as the source
of life, because it is endned with a plenitude of life to commu-
nicate to us. ln this 1 agree with Gyril, in understanding that
declaration of Christ, “As the Father hath life in himself,
so hath he given to the Son to have life in himself.'’ (p) For
in this passage, heis not speaking of the attributes which he
possessed with the Father from the beginning, but of the gifts
with which he was adorned in the flesh in which he appeared ;
therefore he showed that the fulness of life dwelt in his hu-
manity, that whoever partook of his fiesh and blood might, at
the same time, enjoy a participation of life. For, as the water
of a fountain is sometimes drunk, sometimes drawn, aod some-
times conveyed in furrows for the irrigation of lands, yet the
fountain does not derive such an abundance for so many usea
from itself, but from the spring which is perpetually flowing
