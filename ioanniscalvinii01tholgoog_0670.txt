unrighteous decrees, to turn asida the needy from judgment,
and to take away the right from the poor, that widows may be
their prey, and that they may rob the fatherless.” (t)

XXX. And here is displayed his wonderful goodness, and
power, and providence; sor sometimes he raises up some of
his servants as public avengers‚ and arms them with his com·
mission to punish unrighteous dommalich, and to deliver from
their distressing calamities a people who have been unjustly
oppressed: sometimes he accomplishes this end by the fury of
men who meditate and attempt something altogether different.
'Phus he liberated the people of Israel from the tyranny os
Pharaoh by Moses3 from the oppression os Chusan by Othniel;
and from other yokes by other kings and judges. Thus he
subdued the pride os 'Pyre by the Egyptians; the insolence of
the Egyptians by the Assyrians; the haughtiness of the Assyriam
by the Chaldeans 3 the confidence of Babylon by the Medos and
perstans, aster Cyrus had subjugated the Medos. The ingra-
titude of the kings of Israel and J udah, and their impious rebel·

not all in the same manner. The former, when they wera
called forth to the performance os such acts by a legitimata
commission from God, in taking arms against kings, were not
chargeable with the least violation of that majesty with which
kings are invested by tho ordination of God 3 but, being armed
with authority from Heaven, they punished an inferior power
by a superior ona, as it is lawsul sor kings to punish their in·
serior officers. The latter, though they were guided by tha

his work without being conscious os it, nevertheless contem·
plated in their hearts nothing but evil.

XXXI. But whatever opinion be formed of the acts of men,
yet the Lord equally executed his work by them, when he
broke the sanguinary seeptres of insolent kings‚ and over·
turnedtyrannical governments. Let princes hear and sear. But,
itt the mean while, it behoves us to use the greatest cantion,
that we do not despise or violate that authority of magistrates,
which is entitled to the greatest veneration, which God has es·
tablished by the most solemn commands, even though it reside
in those who are ntost unworthy of it, and who, as far as in
them lies, pollute it by their iniquity. For though the cor·
