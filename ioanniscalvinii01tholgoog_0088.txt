and great, for most men not only presumo, without modesty or
reverence, to address God concerning their follies, and impu·
dently to utter at his tribunal whatever has amused thern in
their reveries or dreams, but so great is their folly or stupidity,
that they dare to obtrude upon God all their soulest desires,
which they would be exceedingly ashamed to reveal tomen.
Some heathens have ridiculed and even detested this presump-
tion, but the vice itself has always prevailed3 and hence ir
was that the ambitious chose Jupiter as their patron, the ava-
ricious, Mercury; the lovers of learning, Apollo and Minerva;
the warlike, Mars ; and the libidinous, Venus3 just as in the
present age (as I have lately hinted) men indulge a greater
linense to their unlawful desires in their prayers, than if they
wore conversing in a jocular manner with their equals. God
suffers nothis indulgence to be so mocked, but asserts his
power, and subjecta our devotions to his commanda. 'Phere-
lore we ought to remember this passage in John : “This is the
confidence that we have in him, that, if we ask any thing ae·
cording to his will, he heareth us.²' (lt) But as our abilities are
very unequal to such great perfectior, we must seek some
remedy to relieve us. As the attention of the mind ought to
be fixed on God, so it is necessary that it should be followed
by the affection ol the heart. But they both remain sar below
this elevation 3 or rather, to spealr more consistently with truth,
they grow weary and fail in the ascent, or are carried a contrary
course. Therefore, to assist this imbecility, God gives us the
Spirit, to be the director of our prayers, to suggest what is
right, and to regulate our affectione. For “the Spirit helpeth
our infirmities; for we know not what we should pray sor as
we ought3 but the Spirit itself malreth intercession for us
with groanings which cannot be uttered;'’ (i) not that he
really prays or groans ; buthe excites within us confidence,
desires, aud siglis, to the conception of which our native
powers were altogether inadequate. Nor is it without reason
that Paul terms those “ groanings,'’ which arise from believers
under the influence of the Spirit, “unutterable3 '³ because
they who are truly engaged in prayers, are not ignorant that
they are so perplexed with dubious anxieties, that they can
scarcely decide what it is expedient to utter3 and even
while they are attempting to lisp, they stammer and hesitate ;
whence it follows that the ability ol praying rightly is a pe-
culiar gift. These things are not said in order that we may
indulge our own indolence, resigning the office of prayer to the
Spirit of God, and growing torpid in that negligence to which
we are too prone; according ro the impious errors of some, that
