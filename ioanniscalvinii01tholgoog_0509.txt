is there much plausibility in the objectiou, that it is nowhere
stated that even a single infant was baptized by the hands of
the apostles. For though no such circumstance is expressly
mentioned by the evangeliste, yet, on the other hand, as they
are never excluded when mention happens to be made os the
baptism of any family, who can rationally conclude from this,
that they were not baptized? If there were any force in such
arguments, women might as well be interdicted from the
Lord’s supper, because we have no account of their having
been admitted to it in the days os the apostles. But in this
we are content with the rule of saith. For when we consider
the design of the institution os the Lord's supper, the conclu-
sion is easy respecting the persons who ought to be admitted
to a participation of it. We observo the same rule also in the
case of baptism. For when we consider the end os its insti·
tution, we evidently perceive that it belongs to insants as well
as to adults. Therefore they cannot be deprived os it without
a manifest evasion ot' the will of the Divine Author. What
they circulate among the uninformed multitude, that after the
resurrection os Christ, a long series of years passed, in which
infant baptism was unknown, is shamesully contrary to truth;
forthere is no ancient writer who does not refer its origin, as
a matter ol certainty, to the age of the apostles.

IX. It remeius sor us briefly to show what advantage results
t'rom this ceremony, both to believers who present their children
to the Church to be baptized, and to the infanta themselves
who are washed in the holy water; to guard it from being
despised as useless or unimportant. But if any man takes it
into his head to ridicule infant baptism on this pretext, he holds
the command os circumcision, which was given by the Lord, in
equel contempt. For what will they allega to impugn the bap-
tism oi infanta, which may not be retorted against circumci-
sion? Thus the Lord avenges tha arrogance ot' those, who
sorthwith condemn what their carnal sense does not comprehend.
But God furnishes us with other weapons to repel their folly3
nor does this sacred ordinance of his appointment, which we
experience to be a source os peculiar support and consolation to
our saith, deservo to be called unnecessary. For this sign of
God, communicated to a child, like the impress of a seal,
ratifies and confirma the promise given to the pious parent,
declaring that the Lord will be a God, not only to him, but
also to his seed, and that he is determined to exercise his
goodness and grace, not only towards him, but towards his
posterity even to a thousand generations. 'Phe manifestation
here given of the mercy os God, in the first place, fumishes the
most abundant matter sor the celebratior of his glory; and in
the second place, tills picus breasts with more than common
joy, by which they are excited to a more ardent return of
