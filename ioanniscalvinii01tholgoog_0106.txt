ridled they strenuously aim at that which they do not immedi-

XVII. But since there is no one 01 the human racc worthy
to present himself to God, and to enter into his presence, our
heavenly Father himself, to deliver us at once from shame and
sear, which might justly depress all our minds‚ has given us
his Son Jesus Christ our Lord to be our Advocato and Mediator
with him 3 (c) introduced by whom we may boldly approach
him, confident, with such an intercessor, that nothing we ask
111 his name will be denied us, as nothing can be denied to him
by his Father. And to this must be referred all that we have
hitherto advaneed concaming saith, because, as the promise
recommends Christ to us as the Mediator, so, unless our hope
01 success depend on him, it deprives 110011 01 011 the benefit
01 prayer. Foras soon as we reflect on the terrible majesty of
God, we cannot but be excecdingly afraid, and driven aivay
110111 111111 by a eonsciousness 01 our unworthIness, till we dis·
cover Christ 00 the Mediator, who changes the throne 01 dread-
ful glory into a throne 01 graee3 as tbe apostle 0100 01110110 us
to “ come boldly unto the throne 01 grace, that we may obtain
mercy, and find grace to help 111 time 01 need.” (d) And as
there is a rule given 101 calling upon God, as well as 0 promise
· that they shall be heard who eall upon him, so we are par-
ticularly enjoined to invoke him in the name 01 Christ ; and
we have an express promise, 11101 what we ask 111 his name we
shall obtaIn. “Hitherto (says he) ys have asked nothing in
my name: ask, and ye shall receive. At that day ye shall ask
in my name ; and whatsoever ye shall ask in my name, that
will l do, that the Father may be glorided in the Son.’' (e)
Hence it is plaiu beyond all controversy, that they who eall
upon God in any other name than that 01 Christ, are guilty 01
acontumacious neglect 01 bis preceptis, and 0 total disregard
01 his will; and that they have no promise 01 any success.
For, as Paul says 01 Christ, “All the promises 01 God in him
{ii (yepde in him amen ; ” that is, 010 confirmed and sul-

XVIII. And we must carefully remark the circumstance 01
the time when Christ commands his disciples to apply 10 his
Intercession, thch was to be aster his ascension to heaven3
“At that day (says he) ye shall ask 111 my namc.’' lt 10001-
tain 11101110111 the beginning no prayers had been heard but 101
the sake 01 the Mediator. For this reason the Lord 11011ορ-
pointed in the law, that the priest alone should enter the sanc·
tuary, bearing on his shoulders the names 01 the tribes 01 lsrael,
