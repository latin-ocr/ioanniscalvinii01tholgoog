naturally endued with the saculties os seeing and hearing, but
Christ accoinplishes this in our hearts by special and preter·
natural grace.

X. 'Fhis reasoning will also serve for a solution of the objec-
tions with which some persons are greatly disturbed3 that if we
attribute to creaturas either the increase or confirmation of saith,
we derogato from the Spirit os God, whom we ought to acknow-
ledge as its sole Author. For we do not, at the same time, deny
him the praise of its confirmation and increase; but we assert
that the way in which he increases and confirms our saith is by
preparing our minds‚ by his inward illumination, to receive that
confirmation which is proposed in the sacramenta. If the way
in which this has been expressed be too obscure, it shall be
elucidated by the following similitude. If you intend to per-
suade a persou to do a certain act, you will consider all the
reasons calculated to draw him over to your opinion, and to
constrainhim to submit to your advice. But you will make no
impression upon him, unless he possess a perspicuous and acute
judgment, to be able to determine what sorce there is in your
reasons ; unless his mind also be docile, and prepared to listen to
instruction, and lastly, unless he have conceived such an opiu-
ion of your fidelity and prudence as may prepossess him in favour
os your sentiments. For there are many obstinate spirits, never
to be moved by any reasons; and where a person's fidelity is
suspected, and his authority despised, little effect will be pro·
duced, even with those who are disposed to leam. On the
contrary, let all these things be present, and they will insure
the acquiescenee of the person advised, in those counsels which
he would otherwise have derided. This work also the Spirit
effecta within us. Lest the word should assail our ears in vain,-
lest the sacramenta should in vain atrike our eyes, -he shows us
that it is God who addresses us in them; he sostens the hard·
neas of our hearts, aud forms them to that obedience which is
due to the word of the Lord; in fine, he conveys those exter-
nal words and sacraments srom the ears into the soul. Our
saith is confirmed, therefore, both by the word and by the
sacramenta, when they place before our eyes the good-will of
our heavenly Father towards us, in the knowledge of which
all the firmness of our saith consists, and by which its strength
is augmented3 the Spirit confirms it, when he makes this
confirmation effeetual by engraving it on our minds. ln the
mean time, the Father os lights cannot be prohibited from illu·
minating our minds by means of the lustre of the sacraments,
as he enlightens our bodily eyes with the rays os the sun.

Lord has shown in a parable‚ by calling it “ , ’ ’
