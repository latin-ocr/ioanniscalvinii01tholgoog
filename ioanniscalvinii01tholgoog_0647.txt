arduous, may bc alleviated. For what an ardent pursuit οἱ
integrity, prudence‚ clemency‚ moderatiori, and innocence ought
they to prescribe to themselves, who are consciens of having
⁴been constituted ministare ol the Divina justice! With what
confidence will they admit iniquity te their tribunal, which they
understand to be the throne oi the living God? With what
andacity will they pronounce an nujust sentence with that
mouth which they know to be the destined urgan os Divina
truth? With what conscience will they subscribe to impleus
decrees with that hand which they know to ba appointed to re·
gister the edicts os God? ln short, is they remember that they
arc the vicegerents of God, it behoves them to watch with all
care, earnestness, and diligence, that in their administration they
may exhibit to men an image, as it wenc, os the providence,
care, goodness, benevolence, and justice ol God. And they must
constantly bear this in mind, that il in all cases “ he be cursad

who is with you in tha judgment. Wherefore now let the sear
of the Lord be upon you: take heed and do it; forthere isne
iniquity with the Lord our God.'' (r) And in another place it
is said, “ God standeth in the congregation of the mighty: he
judgeth among the gods; '² (s) that they may be animated to
their duty, when they understand that they are delegated by
God, to whom they must one day render an account of their
administration. And this admonition is entitled to have con·
siderabla weight with them; lor if they fail in their duty,
they not only injure men by criminally distressing them, but
aven offend God by polluting his sacred judgments On the ⁴
other hand, it opens a source of peculias consolation to them
to reflect, that they are not employed in prolana things, or
occupations unsuitable to a servant os God, but in a most sacred
function, inasmuch as they executa a Divina commission.

not offer an insult to God himself, who cannot but be involved
