and proof of his goodness and faithfulness, we shall have no
reason to fear lest our hopes be confounded or our expectations
disa inted.

Xhiolll. Let us conclude this argument in the following
manner: Since the Scripture represents the principal part os
Divine worship to be an invocation of God, as he, in preference
to all sacrifices, requires of us this duty of piety, no prayer can
without evident sacrilege be directed to any other. Wherefore
also the Psalmist says, “ lf we have stretched out our hands
to a strange god, shall not God search this out? ” (c) Resides,
since God will only be involred in saith, and expressly eom·
mands prayers to be conformed to the rule of his word; finally,
since saith founded on the word is the source of true prayer, -
as soon as the least deviation is made from the word, there must
necessarily be an immediate corruption os prayer. But it has
been already shown, that if the whole Scripture be consulted,
this honour is there claimed for God alone. With respect to

· the office of intercession, we have also seen, that it is peculiar

to Christ, and that no prayer is acceptable to God, unless it be
sanetified by this Mediator. And though believers mutually
pray to God for their brethren, we have proved that this dero·
'gates nothing from the sole intercession of Christ; because
they all commend both themselves and others to God in a
reliance upon it. Moteover we have argued, that this is inju·
diciously applied to the dead, of whom we nowhere read that
they are commanded to pray for us. The Scriptura frequently
exhorta us to the mutual performance of this duty for each
other, bnt concerniog the dead there is not even a syllable;
and James, by connecting these two things, “Confess your
saults one to another, and pray one for another,’' tacitly ex·
eludes the dead. (d) Wherefore, to condemn this error, this
one reason is sufficient, that right prayer originales in faith,
and that saith is produced by hearing the word of God, where
there is no mentiones this fictitious intercession; sor the terne·
rity of superstition has chosen itself advocates, who were not
of Divine appointment. For whilst the scripture abourrds
with many forms of prayer, there is not to be found an exam·
ple of this advocacy, without which the Papists believe there
carr be no prayer at all. Besides, it is evident that this super·
stition has ariserr from a want of saith, because they either
were not content with Christ as their intercessor, or entirely
denied him this glory. The latter of these is easily proved
from their impudencc, for they adduce no argument more valid
to show that we need the mediatiorr of the saintS, than when
they object that we are unworthy of familiar aeeess to God.
