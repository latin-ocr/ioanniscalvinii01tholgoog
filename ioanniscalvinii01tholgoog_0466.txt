some are in the habit of objecting against this sentiment
are exceedingly week and frivolous. They allege, that is
our saith be good, it cannot be made better3 for that there is no
real saith except that which rests on the mercy of God, without
any wavering‚ instability, or distraction. lt would have been
better for such persons to pray, with the apostles, that the Lord
would increase their saith, (l) than conlidently to boast os such
a perfectiori of saith, as no one of the sons of meu ever yet
attained, or ever will attain, in this lif. Let them answer
what kind os saith they suppose him to have possessed, who
said, “Lord, 1 believe; help thou mine nubelief.'' (m) For
even that, though yet only iu its commencement, was a good
faith, and capable of being improved by the removal of un·
belief. But there is no argument which more sully refutes
thern than their own conscience 3 for if they consess themselves
sinuers, which, whatever they may wish, they cannot deny, they
must be obliged to impute it to the imperfectiori of their saith.

Vlll. But they say, Philip answered the eunuch, thathc might
be baptized “ is '³ he “ believed with all ’' his “ heart.’' (u) And
what room, they ask, is there here sor the confirmation of bap·

tism, where faith fills the whole heartl On the other hand,l .

ask them, whether they do not feel a large part of their beart
destitute os saith, and whether they do not deily know some
fresh increase of it. A heathen gloried that he grew old in
learning. We Christiane are miserable indeed if we grow old
in making no improvement, whose saith ought to be advancing
from one stage to another till its attainment of perfect man-
hood. “'l'o believe with all the heert,'' therefore, in this
passage, is not to believe Christ in a perfect manner, but only
significa embraeing him with sincerity of soul and firmness
of miud; not to be filled with him, but to hunger, thirst, end
sigh after him with ardent affection. lt is the custom of the
Scriptures to say that any thing is done with the whole heart
which is done with sincerity of mind, asin these and other
passages: “With my whole heert have l sought thee ; ’' “l
will praise the Lord with my whole heart.'’ (o) On the con-
trary, when it rebukes the fraudulent and deceitsul, it reproaches·

thern with “a double heart.''(p) Our adversaries further
allege, thetis saith be increesed by the sacraments‚ the Holy
Spirit must have been given in vain, whose work and influ-
ence it is to commence, to confirm, and to consummate saith.
I consess that saith is the peculiar and entire work of the Holy
Spirit, by whose illumination we know God and the treasures
of his gooduess, and without whose light our mind is too blind
