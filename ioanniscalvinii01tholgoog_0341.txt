XXlll. The casa of a bishop is different from thet of a king,
who still retains the honour and title ofa king, though he
executa none of the royal functione. But in judging of a
bishop, regard is to be paid to the commission of Christ, which
ought always to continueinforca in the Church. Let the Roman-
ists, therefore, fumishme withesolution of this difficulty. ldeny
that their pontifl' is the chief of bishops, because he is not a
bishop himself. Now, they must prove this second member of
my position to be false, if they will obtain the victory in the first.
But what must be the conclusion, if he not only has no charac-
