was paid to those reasons os Cyprian, which surely ought to be
sufficient to influence a Christian mind. He says, “How do
we tcach or stimulate them to shed their blood in the confession
of Christ, is we refuse bis blood to them who are about to
engage in the confliet? Or how do we prepare them for the
cup of martyrdom, if we do not first admit thern, by the right
of communion, to drinlr the cupos the Lord in the Churehi ''
The canonists restrict the deerec os Gelasius to the priests,
but this is too puerile acavil to need any refutation.

L. Thirdly; Why did Christ, when he presented the bread,
simply say, “Tahe, eat ; '’ but when he presented the cup,
“Drinlr yo cll of it ; '³ as is he expressly intended to guard
against the subtlety οἱ Satan? Fourthly3 ls, as our adversa·
ries pretend, our Lord admitted to his supper none but sacri-
ficing priests, what man ean be found so presumptuous aa to
invite toa participatior] os it strangers whom the Lord has
excltrded? and to a participation os that gift, over which they
could have no power, without any command from him who
alone could give it? And with what confidenoe do they now
take upon them to distribute to tha people the symbol ol the
body os Christ, if they have neither the command nor example
nithe Lord? Fifthlyj Did Paul affirm what was false, when
he said to the Corirrthians, “ 1 have received os the Lord that
which also 1 delivered to you?'' (r) For he afterwards de·
clares what he had delivered, which was, that all, without any
distinction, should communicate in both symbols. 1f Paul had
“received of the Lord‚” that all were to be admitted without
any distinction, let them consider from whom they have rc-
eeived‚ who exclude almost all the people os God; sor they
cannot now pretend their doctrine to have originated from God,
with whom is “not yea and nay.'’ (s) And yet they dare to
shelter such abominatione under the name of tho Churcb, and
to defend them under that pretext; as is tha Churoh could
consist ol‘ those antichrists, who so easily trample under foot,
mutilate, and abolish the doctrine and institutions of Christ;
orasis the apostolic Chttrch, in which true religion diaplayed
all its influence, were not the true Church.
