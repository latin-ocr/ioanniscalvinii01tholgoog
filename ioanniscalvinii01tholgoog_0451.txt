they say, are not binding on Christiane at large. What anti-
quity will they plead here? This notiori never entered into
the mind of one of the ancieuts. They all, with one conserit,
declara that there was nota syllable uttered by Christ which
l we are not bound to obey; and without any hesitation they
uniformly and expressly represent the passages in question as
commanda, which these sagacious interpreters pretend to have
been delivered by Christ rnerely as cnunsels. Butes we have
already shown that this isa most pestilent error, it may suffice
to have briefly remarhed here, that the monachiam which
exists at present, is founded on the opinion, which justly de-
serves to be execrated by all believers, that some rule of life
niay be imagined more perfect than the common orie given by
God to all the Church. Whatever superstructure is raised on
this foundation, cannot but be abominable.

Xlll. But they adduce another argument in proof of their
perfectiori, which they consideras most conclusive; our Lord
said to the young maii who inquired what was the perfectiori
’ of righteonsness, ‘¹ lf thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that thou
hast, and give to the poor.'' (l) Whether they do this, 1 shall
not now dispute; let us at present put the case that they do.
They boast, therefore, that they have been made perfect by
forsaking all that they have. lf the whole of perfectiori con-
sist in this, what does Paul mean, when he says, “ 'Phoughl
bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and have not charity, 1
arn nothing?” (m) What kind of perfectiori is that whicliis
reduced to nothing by the absence of charity? Here they
will be obliged to answer, that though this is tlie principal, yet
it is not the only work of perfectiori. But here also they are
centradicted by Paul, who hesitates not to make “charity,’'
without any such renunciation, “the bond of perfection.'' (ri)
lf it is certain, that there is rio discordarice between the Master
and the disciple, -and Paul explicitly denies the perfectiori of
aman to consist in the renunciation of his property, and, oii
the other hand, asseris that it may exist without that relinquish·
ment,—it is necessary to examine in what sense we are to
understand the declaration oi Christ, “If thou wilt be perfect,
go and sell that thou hast.” Now, there will be no ob·
scurity in the sense, if we consider, what ought always to be
considered in all the discourses of Christ, to whom the words
are addressed. A young inan inquires, “What good thing
shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life ?’' (o) As the ques·
tion related to works, Christ refers him to the law; and that
justly; for, considered in iucif, it hithe way of eternal life,
