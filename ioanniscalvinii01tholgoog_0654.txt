be any excessive or unreasonable severity, uor ought any cause
to be given for considering the tribunal aa a gibbet prepared
sor all who are accused. For l am notan advocate for un·
necessary cruelty, nor can I conceive the possibility of an
equitable sentence being pronounced without mercy; of which
Solomon affirms, that “mercy and truth preserve the kiug;
aud his throne is upholden by mercy.'’ (v) Yet it behoves the
magistrate to be on his guard against both these errors; that
he do not, by excessive severity, wound rather than heal; or,
through a superstitious affectatiou os clemency, fall into a mis·
taken humanity, which is the worst kind os cruelty, by indulg-
inga weak and ill-judged lenity, to the detriment of multitudes.
For ir is a remark not without foundation, that was auciently
applied to the government os Nerva, that it is bad to live ⁸
under a prince who pemrits nothing, but much worse to live
under oue who permits every thing.

Xl. Νοντ, as it is sometimes necessary sor kings and natione
to take up arms sor the infliction of such public verrgeance, the
same reason will lead us to iufer the lawfulness of wars which
are undertaken sor this end. Foris they have been intrusted
with power to preserve the tranquillity os their own territorias,
to suppress the seditious tumults os disturbem, to succour the
victims os oppression, and to punish crimes—can they exart
this power for a better purpose, than to repel the violence ol'
him who disturbs both the private repose of individuals aud
the general tranquillity os the nation; who excites insurrec-
tions, and perpetratas acts os oppression, cruelty, and every
species of crime? Is they ought to be the guardians aud de·
fenders of the laws, it is incumbent upon them to defeat the
efforts of all by whose injustice the discipline of the lawsis
corrupted. And if they justly punish those robbers, whose in·
juries have only extended to a few persone, shall they-suffer
a whole district to be plundered aud devastated with impunity?
For there is no difference, whether hc, who in a hostile man·
ner invades, disturbs, and plunders the territory os another to
which he has no right, be a king, or one os the meanest os
mankind: all persons os this description are equally to be con·
sidered as robbers, and ought to be prmished as such. Itis
the dictate both of natural equity, and os the nature of the
office, therefore, that princes are armed, not only to restrain the
crimes ot private individuals by judicial punishments, but also
to defend the territorias committed to their charge by going
to war against any hostile aggression3 and the Holy Spirit, in
many passages of Scriptura, declares such wars to be lawsul.
