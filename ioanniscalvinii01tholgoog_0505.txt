of Christ 3 signifying that, in having been baptized in his name, ·
they had dedicated themselves to him, had avowed him as
their Lord aud Master, and had bound themselves by a solemn
obligation before men ; so that they could never again confess
any other except him, unless they intended to renounce the
confession which they had made at their baptism.

XIV. Now, as we have stated what was the design of our
Lord in the institution of baptism, it is easy to judge in what
manner we ought to use and receive it. Por as it is given for
the support, consolation, and confirmation of our faith, it re·
quires to be received as from the hand of the Author himself:
we ought to consider it as beyond all doubt, that it is he who
speaks to us by this sign, that it is he who purifies and
cleanses us, aud obliterates the remembrance of our sins3 that
it is he who makes us partakers of his death, who demolishes
the kingdom of Satan, who weakens the power of our corrupt

that he as truly ind certainly performs these things inteinally
on our souls, as we see that our bodies are extemally washed,
immersed, and enclosed in water. For this analogy or simili·
tude is a most certain rule of sacraments; that in corporeal
things we contemplate spiritual things, justas if they were
placed before our eyes, as it has pleased God to represent them
to us by such figures: not that such blessings are bound or
enclosed in the sacrament, or that it has the power to impart
them to us; but only because it is a sign by which the Lord
testifies his will, that he is determined to give us all these
things: nor does it merely feed our eyes with a bare prospect of
the symbols, but conducts us at the same time to the thing sig·
nified‚ and efficaciorrsly accomplishes that which it represents.

XV. We may see this exemplified in Cornelius the centu-
rion, who, after having received the remissiori of his sins and
the visible greces of the Holy Spirit, was baptized3 not with a
view to obtain by baptism a more ample remission of sins, but
a stronger exercise of faith, and an increase of confidence from
that pledge. (q) Perhaps it may be objected, “ Why, then, did
Ananias say to Paul, ‘Arise, and be baptized, and wash away
thy sins,’ (r) if sins are not washed away by the efficacy of
baptism itself? ’' 1 answer, We are said to receive or obtain

that which our faith apprehende, as presented to us by the
Lord, whether at the time that he first declares it to us, or
When, by any subsequent testimony, he affords usa more cer·
tarn confirmation of it. Ananias, therefore, only intended to
say to Paul, “ That thou mayest be assured that thy sins are
