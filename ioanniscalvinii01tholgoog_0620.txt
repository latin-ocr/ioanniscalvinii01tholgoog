reason will they assign but their own pleasure? They allege,
that the apostles alone exercised that right, being the sole
dispensers of the Holy Spirit. Are bishops the only apostles;
or are they apostles ot all? Let us, however, grant that also;
why do they not on the same principle contend that none but
bishops ought to touch the sacrament of the blood in the¹
Lord’s supper, which they refuse to the laity, because the
Lord‚ as they say, only gave it to the apostles? If our Lord
gave it to the apostles alone, why do they not infer, Therefore
it ought now to be given to bishops alone? But in this case
they make the apostles simple presbyters3 now, they are hur-
ried away withan extravagant notion suddenly to create them
bishops. Lastly‚ Ananias was notan apostle; yet to him Paul
was sent, that he might receive his sight, be baptized, and be
filled with the Holy Ghost. (a) I will add one question more:
If this was the peculiar office 01 bishops by a Divina right, why
have they dared to transfer 11 10 common presbyters, as we
read in one of the epistles of Gregory?

XI. How srivolous and foolish is the second reason, That
111ογ00111110110011111111011011 more excellent than the baptism in-
stituted by God, because in confirmation the forehead 11011000-
ed with oil, and in baptism the crown of the head ; as though
baptism were performed with 011, and not with water! 1 ap·
peel 10011 believers, whether these deceivers do uot direct all
their efforts to this one object; to corrupt the purity 01 1110
sacraments by the leaven of their false doctrine. lhave already
remarked, in another part of this boolr, that in the sacraments
it is scarcely possible to discern that which is 01 Divine institu-
tion among the multiplicity 01 human inventions. If any 000
did not give credit to that observation 01 mine, let him now at
least believe his own masters. By their passing over the water
without the least notice, it appears that the only thing to
which they attribute much importance 10 baptism, is their own
oil. We, therefore, on the contrary, affirm, that in baptism the
forehead also is laved with water. In comparison with this,
we esteem all their 011 perfectly worthless, whether in baptism
or in confirmation. lf auy one allege that it is sold for more,
this accession of price would only corrupt 1110 good, 11 11 con-
tained any, an impostura of the foulest kind 000 never be
legalized by robbery. In the third reason, they exposa their
impioty‚ when they pretend that a greater augrnentation of
virtues is conferred in confirmation than in baptism. The
apostles, by imposition of hands, dispensed the visible graces
01 1110 Spirit. ln what respect does their unction appear to be
productiva of any advantage? Let us leave these moderatore,
