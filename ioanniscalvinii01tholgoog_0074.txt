010 01 greater importance than is generally believed. For
when the conscience has once fallen into the snare, it enters 0
long and inextricable labyrinth, from which it is afterwards
difficult to escape; if 0 111011 begin to doubt the lawfulness 01
using flax in sheets, shirts, handlrerchiefs, naplsins, and table
cloths‚ neither will he be certain respecting hemp, and 01 1001
he will doubt of the lawfulness 01 using tow3 for 110 will
consider with himself whether he cannot eat without table
cloths or nephins, whether he cannot do without handkerchiefs.
If any one imagine delicate food to be unlawful, he will ere
long have 110 tranquillity before God in eating brown broad and
common viands, while he remembers that 110 might support
his body with 11100101 0 quality still inferior. If he hesitate
respecting good wine, 110 will afterwards be unable with any
peace of conscience to drink the most vapid; and at last he will
not presume even to touch purer and sweeter water than others.
In short, he will come to think it criminel to step over a twig
that lies across his path. For this is the commenoement of no
trivial controversy; but the disputa is whether the use of cer·
tain things be agreeable to God, whose will ought to guide all
our resolutione and all our actions. 'Phe necessary consequence
is, that some are hurried by despair into a vortex of confusion,
from which they see no way of escape3 and some, despising
God, and casting off all fear of him, make a way of ruin 101
themselves. For all, who are involved in such doubts, which
way soever they turn their views, behold something offensive
to their consciences presenting 110011 011 every side.

Vlll. “I know,'' says Paul, “ that 111010 10 nothing unclean
of itself; but to him thet esteemeth any thing to be unclean,
to him it is 1111010011.”(0) In these words he makes all ex·
ternal things subject to our liberty, provided that our minda
have regard to this liberty before God. But if any supersti-
tious notion cause us to semple, those things which were
naturally pure become contaminated to us. Wherefore 11001111-
joins, “Happy is he that condemneth not himself in that
which he alloweth. And he that doubteth is condemned if
110 001, because he cateth not 01 faith; for whatsoever 101101
of faith is sin.” (p) Are not they, who in these perplexities
show their superior boldness by the security 01 their presump-
tion, guilty of departiug from God? whilst they who 010 deeply
affected with the true 1001 01 God, when they 010 even con·
strained to admit many things to which their own consciences
010 averse, are filled with terror and consternation. No persona
of this description receive any of the gifts 01 God with thanks·
giving, by which alone Paul, nevertheless, declares them to be
all sanctified to our use. (q) 1 mean a thanksgiving proceeding
