the virtues os a bishop; these men teach that it isa vice not
to be tolerated in the clergy, and not content with this geue·
ral censure, they call it carnal pollution and impurity, which
is the language of syricius, one of the pontiffs, recited in their
canons. Let every man reflcct srorn what source these things
can have proceeded. Christ has been pleased to put such
honour upon marriage, as to melre it an image of his sacred
union with the Church. What could be said more, in com·
mandationes the dignity os marriage? With what sace can
that be called impure and polluted, which exhibite a similitude
os the spiritual grace os Christ?

XXV. Now, though their prohibition is so clearly repugnant
to the word cf God, yet they find something in the Scripturas to
urge in its defense. The Levitical priests, whenever it came
to their turn to minister at the altar, were required not to co·
habit with their wives, that they might be pure and immacu·
late to perform the sacrifices, it would therefore be exceedingly
unbecoming for our sacraments, which are far more excellent
andos daily recurrence, to be administered by married men.
As though the evangelical ministry and the levitical priest-
hood were one and the same office. On the contrary, the
Levitical priests were antitypes, representing Christ, who, as
the Mediator between God and man, was to reconcile the
F'ather to us by his perfect purity. Now, as it was impossible
sor sinners to exhibit in every respect a type of his sauctity,
yet in order to display some faint shadows os it, they were
commanded to purify themselves in a manner beyond what is
common among men, whenever they approached the sanctuary;
because on those occasions they properly represented Christ, in
appearing at the tabemacle, which was a type cs the heavenly
tribunal, as mediators to reconcile the people to God. As the
pastors of the Church now sustain no such office, the comparison
is nothing to the purpose. Wheresore the apostle, without any
exception, confidently pronounces, that “marriage is honourable
in all ς but whoremongers arrd adulterers God will judge.’' (s)
And tlte apostles themselves have proved by their own example
that marriage is not unbecoming the sanctity os any office,

their wives, but toolr them about with thern. (g)

XXVI. lt has also betrayed egregious impudence, to insist
on this appearance of chastity as a necessary thing, to the great
disgrace of the ancient Church, which aboundcd with such
peculias Divine knowledge, but was still more eminent for
sanctity. For is they pay no regard to the apostles, whom
they osten have the hardihood to treat with contempt, what
