lation; for while itis certain that whatever the Lord confers
upon his members and ours belong to us, our hope is confirmed
by all the benefits which they enjoy. But in order to embrace
the unity ol the (lhurch in this manner, it is unnecessary, as
we have observed, to see the Ohurch with our eyes, or leel it
with our hands ; on the contrary, from its being an object ol
saith, we are taught that it is no less to be considered as exist-
ing, when it escapes our observation, thanis it were evident
to our eyes. Nor is our saith the worse, because it acknow·
ledges the Church which we do not fully comprehend3 sor we
are not commanded here to distinguish the reprobate from the
elect, which is not our province, but that of God alone; we
are only required to be assured in our minds, that all those
who, by the mercy of God the Father‚ through the efficacibus
intluence os the Holy Spirit, have attained to the participation
of Christ, are separated as the peculiar possession and portion
of God, and that being numbered among them, we arc parta-
lrers of such great grace.

IV. But as our present design is to treat of the visible
Ohurch, we may leam even l'rom the title of mother, how use·
ful and even necessary it is sor us to know her; since there is
no other way of entrance into lise, unless we are conceived by
her, born of her, nourished at her breast, and contiuually pre-
served under her care and govemment till we are divested os
this mortal flesh, and “become like the angels.’' (le) For our
infirmity will not admit os our dismission from her school; we
must continue under her instruction and discipline to the eud
os our lives. It is also to be remarked, that out os her bosom
there can be no hope of remission of sins, or any saltatim,
according to the testimony ol Joel and Isaiah3 (1) which is con-
firmed by Ezekiel, (m) when he denounces that those whom
God excludes from the heavenly life, shall not be emolled
among his people. So, on the contrary, those who devote
themselves to the service of God, are said to inscribe their
names among the citizens of Jerusalem. For which reason the
Psalmist says, “ Remember me, Ο Lord, with the favour that
thou bearest unta thy people: Ο visit me with thy salvation;
that l may see the good os thy chosen; that 1 may rejoice in
the gladness ot‘ thy nation; that Imay glory with thine in·
heritance.” (n) In these words the paternal favour ol' God, and
the peculiar testimony of the spiritual life, are restricted to his
floclr, to teach us that it is always fatally dangerous to be
separated from the Ghurch.

V. But let us procced to state what belongs to this subject.
