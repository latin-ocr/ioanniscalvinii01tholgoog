is never overcome by any blemishes, but purifies and obliterates
all our defilements. Now, from this doctrine we ought not to
take a license for the commission of future sins, for it is very
far from inculcating such presumption; it is only delivered to
those who, when they have smned, groan under the fatigue
and oppression of their transgressions; iu order to afford them
some relief and consolation, and to preserve them from sinlring
into confusion and despair. Thus Paul says, that Christ was
“set forth to be a propitiation for the remissiori of sins that
are past.’' (a) He does not deny that we have a constant and
perpetual remissiori of sins in Christ, but signifies that he has
been given by the Father only to miserable sinners, who sigh
for the physician to heal the wounds of a guilty conscience.
To such the mercy of God is offered3 while those who, from a
remissiou of punishment, seek to derivo an occasion and license
for sinning, do nothing but draw down upon themselves the
wrath and vengeance of God.

tv. llrnow the common opinion is, that remissiori of sins,
which at our first regeneration we receive by baptism alone, is
afterwards obtained by repentance and the beuefit of the heys
But the advocates of this opinion have fallen into an error, for
want of considering that the power of the keys, of which they
speak, is so dependent on baptism that it cannot by any means
be separated from it. lt is true, that the sinner receives re·
mission by the ministry of the Church; but not without the
preaching of the gospel. NoW, what is the nature of that
preaching? That we are cleansed from our sins by the blood
of Christ. What sign and testimony of that ablution is there,
except baptism? We see, then, how this absolution is referred
to baptism. This error has produced the imaginary sacrament
of penance; on which 1 have touched a little already, aod shall
finish what remeius in its proper place. Now, it is no wonder
if meu, whose groveling mindo were inordinately attached to
external things, have betrayed that corrupt propensity‚ by a
discontent with the pure institution of God, and an introduc·
tion of new expedients invented by themselves3 as if baptism
itself were not asacrament of repentance; butif repentance
be enjoined upon us as long as we live, the virtue of baptism
ought to be extended to the same period. Wherefore it is
evident that the pious, whenever, in any part of their lives, they
are distressed witha consciousness of their sins, may justly have
recourse to the remembrance of baptism, in order to confirm
themselves in the confidence of their interest in that one per·
petual ablution which is enjoyed in the blood of Christ.

V. Baptism is also attended with another advantage: it
