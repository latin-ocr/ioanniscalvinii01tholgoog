Lord clearly expresses that tecching ought to precede baptism,
and represents baptism as subsequent to faith? Of this order,
an example was furnished even by the Lord Jesus himself,
who was not baptized till he was “about thirty years of
aga” (z) In what various ways do they amberrass themselves,
and betray their ignorance! For it isa mistake, worse than
childish, to consider that commission as the original institution
of lhptism, which Christ had commanded his apostles to ad-
minister from the commencemeot of his preaching. 'l'hey
have no reason to contend, therefore, that the law and rule of
baptism ought to be derived from those two passages, as is they
contained the first institution of it. Though we should in· ,
dulge thern by admitting this error, yet what force is there in
their reasoning? Indead, if we wanted to evade the force of
their arguments, we need not have rccourse to any little sub·
terfuge3 a most ample field presents itself before us. For
while they so violently insist on the order of the words, as to
argue, that, when it is said, “Go teach and baptize,” aud
“he that believeth and is baptized‚” the meaning- is, that
preaching ought to precede baptisrn, and that saith ought to
precede the reception of baptism,-why may not we, on the
other haud, reply, that baptiziug ought to precede teaching the
observance of those things which Christ has commanded, be·
cause it is said, “ Baptize, tcachiug them to observa all things
whatsoever Ι have commanded you.” We have remarked the
same thing on the declarationes Christ, which has just been
quoted, respecting the regeneration of water and of the Spirit;
for if it be understood according to their interpretation, it will
appear from that passage that baptism is prior to regeneration,
because it is mentioned first: Christ teaches that we must be
born again, notos the Spirit and of water, but of water and of
the Spirit.

XXVIII. Their invincible bulwark, in which they place
such great confidence, seems already somewhat shaken; but
as the truth may be sufficiently defended by simplicity, 1 have
no inclination to escape with such sophistical and trivial argu·
ments; they shall therefore have a solid reply. The principal
command which Christ here gives to his apostles, isto preach
the gospel, to which he subjoins the administrationi of baptism
as an appendage. Besides, he says nothing of baptism, any
otherwise than as its administration is subordinate to the office
of teaching. For Christ sends his apostles to promulgate the
gospel to all the nations of the world, that by the doctrine of
salvation they may collect, from every land, men who before
were lost, and introduce them into his kingdom. But what
