church at all, or we must forgive mistalres in those things, of
which persons may be ignorant, without violating the essence
of religion, or incurring the loss of salvation. Here I would
not be understood to plead for any errors, even the smallest, or
to recommend their being encouraged by connivance or flat·
tery. But lmentari, that we ought not, on account of every
trivial difference of sentiment, to abendon the church, which
retains the saving and pure doctrine that iusures the preserva-
tion os piety, and supports the use of the sacramente instituted
by our Lord. In the mean time, is we endeavour to correct
what we disapprove, we are acting iu this case according to our
duty. And to this we are encouragedby the direction of Paul:
“If any thing be revealed to another that sitteth by, let the
first hold his peace.’¹ (a) From which it appears, that every
member of the Ohurch is required to exert himself for the
general edification, according to the measure of his grace, pro-
vided he do it decently and in order; that is to say, that we
should neither forsake the communion of the Ohurch, nor, by
continuing in it, disturb its peace and well regulated discipline.

XIII. But in bearing with imperfectioris of life, we ought
to carry our indulgence a great deal further. For this is a
point in which we are very liable to err, and here Satan lies in
weit to deceive us with no common devices. For there have
always been persons, who, from a false notion of perfect sanc·
tity, as if they were already become disembodied spirits, de·
spised the society of all men in whom they could discover any
remains of human infirmity. Such, in ancient times, were the
Gathari, and also the Donatists, who approached to the same
folly. Such, in the present day, are some of the Anabaptists,
who would be thought to have made advances in piety beyond
all others. There arc others who err, more from an incon·
siderate zeal for righteousness, than from this urneasonable
pride. For when they paremve, that among those to whom
the gospel is preached, its doctrine is not followed by corre·
spondent effecte in the life, they immediately pronounce, that
there no church exists. This is, indeed, a very just ground of
offence, and one for which we furnisb more than sufficient
occasion in the present unhappy age; nor is it possible to ex·
cnse our abominable inactivity, which the Lord will not suffer
to escape with impunity, and which he has already begun to
chastise with heavy scourges. Woe to us, therefore, who, by
the dissolute licentiousness of our crimes, cause weak con-
sciences to be wounded on our account! But, on the other
hand, the error of the persons of whom we now speak, consiste
iu not knowing how to fix any limite to their offence. For
