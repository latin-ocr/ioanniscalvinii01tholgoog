along with them. For though some os the best prayers are
not vocal, yet it is very common, under strong emotionS, sor tha
tangue to brealr forth into sonnds, and the other members into
gestures, without the least ostentation. Hence the uncertain
muttering os Hannah, (rra) somewhat similar to which is expe·
rienced by the saints in all ages, when they break forth into
abrupt and imperfect sounds. The corporeal gestures usually
observed in prayer, such as kneeling and uncovering the head,
are eustoms designed to increase our reverence of God.
XXXIV. Now, we must leam not only a certain rulo, but
also the formos praying; even that which our heavenly Father
has given us by his beloved Son ; (n) in which we may recog·
nize his infinite goodness arrd clemency. For beside advising
and exhorting us to seek him in all our necessities, as chil-
dren, whenever they are afflicted with any distress, are accus·
tomed to have recourse to the protection of their parents3 seeing
that we did not sufficiently perceive how great was our poverty,
what it was right to implore, or what would be suitable to our
condition, he has provided a remedy aven for this our igno·
rauce, and abundantly supplied the deficieneies of our capacity.
For he has prescribed sor us a form, in which he gives a state-
ment of all that it is lawful to desire of him, all that is condu-
cive to our benefit, and all that it is necessary to ask. From
this kindness of his, we derive great consolation in the persuasion
· that we pray sor nothing absurd, nothing injurions or unseason·
able ; in a word, nothing but what is agreeable to him ; since our
peritioris are almost in his own words. Plato, observing tho igno-

> rance os men in presenting their supplicatione to God, which'if

granted were frequently very detrimental to them, prononnces
this to be the best methodos praying, borrowed from an an·
cient poet: “ King Jupiter, give us those things which are
best, whether we pray for themor not ; but command avil
things to remain at a distance from ns, aven though we implore
them.’' And indeed the wisdom of that heathen is conspicu-
cusin this instance, since he considers it as very dangerons to
supplicate the Lord to gratify all the dictatas ol our appetites;
and at the same time discovers our infelicity, who cannot,
without danger, even open our mouths in the presence os God,
unless we be instructed by the Spirit in the right rula os
prayer. (o) And this privilege deserves to be tha more highly
