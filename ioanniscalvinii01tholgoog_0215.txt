nacle were dissolved, we have a building in the heavens,'' adds
that “ whilst we are at home in the body, we are absent from
the iord, and willing rather to be absent frorn the body, and to
be present with the Lord.'’ (e) Unless our souis survive our
bodies, what is it thetis present with God when separated from
thc body? But the apostle removes all doubt when he says
that we are “ come to the spirits of just men made perfect.'’ (s)
By which expression he means, that we are associated with the
holy fathers, who, though dead, still maintain the same piety
with us, so that we cannot be members of Christ without being
united with them. If souls separated from bodies did not retain
their existence so as to bc capable of glory and felicity, Christ
would not have said to the thief, “ Today shalt thou be with
me in paradise.'' (g) supported by such undeniable testimo-
nies, let us not hesitate, after the example of Christ, when we
die, to commend our spirits to Cod; or, like Stepheu, to resign
them to the care of Christ, who is justly called the faithful
“Shepherd and Bishop of sonls.'' Over-cnrious inquiry re·
specting their intermediate state is neither lawful nor useful.
Many persons exceedingly perplex themselves by discussing
what place they occupy, and whether they already enioy thc
glory of heaven, or not. But it is folly and presumption to
push our inquiries on unknown things beyond what God per·
mits us to know. The Scriptura declares that Christis present

with them, and receives them into paradise, where they enjoy
consolation, and that the souls of the reprobate endure the tor·

ments which they have deserved3 but it proceeds no further.
Now, what teacher or doctor shall discover to us that which God
has concealed? The question respecting place is equally senseless
and futile; because we know that the soul has no dimensions
like the body. The blessed assemblage of holy spirits being
called the bosom of Abraham, teaches us that it is enough for
us, at the close of this pilgrimage, to be received by the common
Father os believers, and to participate with him in the fruit of
his faith. In the mean while, as the Scripture uniformly com·
manda usto look forward with eager expectation to the coming
of Christ, and defers the crown of glory which awaits ns till
that period, let us be content within these limits which God
prescribes to us-that the souls of pious men, after finishing
their laborions warfare, depart into a state of blessed rest,
where they wait with joy and pleasure for the fruition of the
promised glory; and so, that all things remain in suspense till
Christ appears as the Redeemer. ’ And there is no doubt that
the condition of the reprobate is the same as Jude assigns to
the devils, who are confined and bound in chains till they are
brought forth to the punishment to which they are doomed.
