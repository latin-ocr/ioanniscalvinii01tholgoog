observing that these and other similar forms of expression were
hyperbolical, they, also, on their part, have promulgated their
hyperbolical dogmas, but in a sense altogether foreign from
the writings of the fathers. For the meaning of Augustino
in that passage was the same as in another, where he says,
“ Tha sacraments of the Mosaic law announced Christ as after-
wards to corne, ours announce him as already come.’' Again:
“They were promises of things to be fulfrlled3 these arc signs
of things accomplished;'’ as if he had said, that the old
sacraments prefigured Christ while he was yet expected, but
that ours exhibit him as present, since he has already come.
Besides, he speaks of the mode of representation, as he also
shows in another place, where he says, “ The law and the
ttllttltlt⁰5nlzltt¹lt⁰t¹¹ilainaltatus lt
t
time announce as already come.” His sentimenta respecting
their tmth and efficacy he declares in several places, as when
he says, “ 'l'he sacraments of the Jews were different t‘rom ours
in the signs; in the thing signified, they were equal; different
in visible form, equal in spiritual efficacy.” Again: “In
different signs, the same faith; in different signs, just as in
different words; because words change their sounds in differ·
ent times, and words arc no other than signs. 'Phe fathers
dranlr the same spiritual drinlr as we ; though their corporeal
drinlr was different. See, then, the signs have been varied
without any change in the faith. To them the Rock was
christ, to ns, that which is placed on the altar is Christ.
And as a great sacrament, they drank the water flowing from
the Rock; what we drink, believers know. lf we consider
the visible form, there was a difference ; if we regard the in-
telligible signification, they drank the same spiritual drink.’'
ln anot-her place: “In the mystery their meat and drinlt were
the same as ours; but the same in signification, not in form;
because the very same Christ was prefigured to them in the
Roclr,and hasbeen manifested tous in the flesh.'’ Yet in
this respect, also, we admit that there is some difference be·
tween their sacraments and ours. For both testify that the
paternal benevolence of God is offered to us in Christ, together
with the graces of the Holy Spirit3 bnt ours testify it in a
more clear and evident manner. ln both there isan exhibi-
tion of Christ, but the exhibition of him in ours is richer and
fuller, corresponding to the difference between the Old Testa-
ment and the New, of which we have already treated. And
this is what was intended by Augustino, whom 1 quote more
frequently than any other, as the best and most faithful writer
of antiquity, when he states, that after the revelation of Christ,
sacramenta were instituted, “ fewer in number, more noble in
