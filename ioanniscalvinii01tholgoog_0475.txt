minds and hearts, and render us capable of receiving this
testimony: and here, also, several distinct favours of God are
eminently displayed. For the sacramente, as we have before
hinted, fulfil to us, on the part of God, the same office as mes·
sengers of joyful intelligence, or earnests for the confirmation
of covenants on the partos men 3 they communicate no grace
from themselves, but announce and shoW, and, as earnests and
pledges, ratify, the things which are given to us by the good·
ness of God. The Holy spirit, whom the sacramente do not
promiscuously impert to all, but whom God, by a peculiar
privilege, confers upon his servants, is he who brings with him
the graces of God, who gives the sacramente admission into
our hearts, and causes them to bring forth fruit in us. Now,
though we do not deny that God himself accompanies his
institution by the very present power of his Spirit, that the ad·
ministration of the sacramente which he has ordained may not
be vain and unfruitful, yet we essert the necessity of a separate
consideration and contemplation of the internal grace of the
Spirit, as it is distinguished from the external ministry. What·
ever God promises and adumbrates in signs, therefore, he really
performs 3 and the signs are not without their effect, to prove
the veracity and fidelity of their Author. 'Phe only question
here is, whether God works by a proper and intrinsic power,
as it is expressed, or resigns the office to external symbols.
Now,'we contend, that whatever instrumente he employs, this
derogates nothing from his supreme operation. When this
doctrine is maintained respecting the sacramente, their dignity
is sufficiently announced, their use plainly signified, their utility
abundantly declared, and a proper moderatiori is preserved in
all these particulare, so that nothing is attributed, which ought
not to be attributed to them, aud nothing that belongs to them
is denied; while there is no admission of that figment, which
places the cause of justification and the power of the Spirit in
the sacramental elementa, as ineo many vehiclesy and that
peculiar power which has been omitted by others is clearly
expressed. Here, also, it must be remarked, that God accom-
plishes within, that which the minister represents and testifies
by the external act3 that we may not attribute to a mortal
man what God challenges exclusively to himself. Augustino
has judiciously suggested the same sentiment. “ How,'’ says
he, “do Moses and God both sanctify? Not Moses instead of

God. Moses does it with visible signs, by his ministry. God “

does it with invisible grace, by his Holy Spirit. Here also
lies all the efficacy of visible sacramente. For what avail
those visible sacramente without that sanctification of invisible
gralofel'lll. The term sacrament, as we have hitherto treated of
