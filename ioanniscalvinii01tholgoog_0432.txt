ing is of no use ou any other account than as an additional
and subordinate assistance to these things, For nothing is
more abominable to God, than when men attempt to impose
upon him by the presentation of signs and external appearances
instead of purity of beart. Therefore he severely reprobatos
this hypocrisy in the Jews, who imagined they had satisfied
God merely by having fasted, while they cherished impions
and irnpnre thoughts in their hearts. “Is it such a fast, saith
the Lord, that I have chosen?”(b) 'I'he fasting of hypo·
crites, therefore, is not only superfluous and useless fatigne, bnt
the greatest abomination. Allied to this is another evil, which
requires the most vigilant cantion, lest it be considered as a
meritorious act, or a species of divine service. For as it is a
thing indifferent in itself, and possesses no other valne than it
derives from those ends to which it ought to be directed, it is
most pernicious superstition to confonnd it with works com·
manded by God, and necessary iu themselves, without refer·
enee to any ulterior object. Such was formerly the folly of the
Manichaeans, in the refutation of whom Angustine most clearly
shows, that fasting is to be held in no other estimation than
on account of those ends which lhcre mention, and that it
receives no approbation from God, unless it bc practised for
their sake. The third error is not so impious, indeed, yet it is
pregnant with danger, to enforce it with extreme rigour as
one of the principat dnties, and to extol it with extravagant
encomiums, so that men imagine themselves to have per·
formed a worlr of peculiar excellence when they have fasted.
In this respect,I dare not wholly excuse the ancient fathers
from having sown some seeds of superstition, and given occa·
sion to the tyranny which afterwards arose. Their writings
contain some sonnd and jndicions sentiments on the subject
of fasting3 but they also contain extravagant praises, which
elevate it to a rank among the principal virtues.

XX. And the superstitious observance of Lent had at that
time generally prevailed, because the common people consi-
dered themselves as performing an eminent act of obedience to
God, and the pastors commended it as a holy imitation of
Christ; whereas it is plain that Christ fasted, not to set an ex·
ample to others, but in order that hy such an introduction to
the preaching of the gospel, he might prove the doctrine not
to be a human invention, but a revelation from heaven. And
it is surprising that men of acute discemmont could ever enter·
tain such a gross error, which is disproved by such numerous
and satisfactory arguments. For Christ did not fast often,
which it was necessary for him to do, if he intended to estab-
