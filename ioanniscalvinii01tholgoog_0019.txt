XI. We must strenuously insist on these two points- first,
thet there never was an action performed bya pious man,
which, if examined by the scrutinizing eye of Divino justice,
would not deserve condemnation; and secondly, if any such
thing be admitted, (though it cannot be the case with any indi·
vidual of mankind) yet being corrupted and contaminated by
the sins, of which its performer is confessedly guilty, it loces
every claim to the Divine favour. And this is the principal
hinge on which our controversy [with the Papists] turns. For
concerning the beginning of justificatiou, there is no disputo
between us and the sounder schoolmen, but we all agree, that a
siuner being freely delivered from condemnation obtains right·
eousness, and that by the remissiori of his sins3 only they,
under the term justification, comprehend that renovation iu
which we are renewed by the Spirit of God to an obedienoe to
the law, and so they describe tho rightoousness of aregenerate
man as consisting iu this-that a man, after having been once
reconciled to God through saith in Christ, is accounted right·
eous with God on account of his good works, the merit of
which is the cause of his acceptance. But the iord, on the
contrary, declares, “that faith was rechoned to Abraham for
-righteousuess,” (le) not during the time while he yet rernaiued
a worshipper of idols, but after he had beeu eminent during
many years for the sanctity of his life. Abraham, then, had for
along time worshipped God from a pure heart, and performed
all that obedienoe to the law, which a mortal man iscapable
of performing; yet, after all, his righteousness consisted in faith.
Whence we conclude, according to the argument of Paul, that
it was not of works. So when the prophet says, “The just
shall live by his faith,”(l) he is not speaking of the impious
and profane, whom the Lord justifies by converting them to
the saith, but his address is directed to believers, and they are
promised life by faith. Paul also removes every doubt, when,
in confirmation of this sentiment, he adduces the following
passage of David: “ Blessed are they whose iniquities are for·
given.’' (m) But it is certain that David spalre not of impious
men, but of believers, whose characters resembled his own; for
he spoke from the experience of his own conscience. Where-
fore it is necessary for us, not to have this blessing for once
only, but to retain it as long as we live. Lastly, he essens,
that the message of a free reconciliation with God, is not only
promulgated for a day or two, but is perpetual iu the church. (n)
BelieverS, therefore, even to the end of their lives, have no
other rightoousness than that which is there described. For
the mediatorial office is perpetually sustained by Christ, by
