of the mass, to cause Christ, if it were possible, to be putto
death again? “For where a testameut is,'’ says the apostle,
“ there must also, of necessity, be the death of the testator.'' (s )
’ The mass pretends to exhibit anew testament of Christ; there·
fore it requires his death. Moreover the victim which is of·
fercd must, os necessity, be slain and immolated. lf Christ be
sacrificed iu every mass, he must be oruelly murdered in a
thousand separate places at once. This is not my argumeut;
it is the reasoniug of the apostle: “ lt was not necessary that
he should offer himself often3 sor then inust he often have suf-
fered since the foundation os the world.'’ (g) ln reply to this,
1 confess, they are ready to charge us with calumny; elleging
that we imputa to them sentiments which they never have
held, nor ever can hold. We know, indeed, that the life and
death of Christ are not in their power; aud whether they in·
tend to murder him, we do uot inquire ; we only mean to show
the absurdities which follow from their impious and abominable
doctrine, aud this we have proved from the mouth of the apostle.
They may reply a hundred times, if they please, that this
sacrifice is without blood; but l shall deny that sacrifices can
change their nature, at the caprice of men; for thus the sacred
and inviolable institution of God would fall to the ground.
Hence it follows, that this principle of the apostle can never
be shaken, that “ without sheddiug of blood is no remission.’' (lt)

VI. We are now to treat of the fourth property os the mass,
which is, to prevent us from pereeiving and reflecting on the
death os Christ, and thereby to deprive us of the benefit result-
ing from it. For who can consider himself as redeemed by
the death of Christ, when he sees a new redemption iu the
mass? Who can be assured that his sins are remitted, when
he sees another remissiori? It is not a sufficient answer, to
say, that we obtain remissiori of sius in the mass, only because
it has been already procured by the death of Christ. For this
is no other thau pretendiug that Christ has redeemed us in

· order that we may redeam ourselves For this is the doctrine

which has been disseminated by the ministers of Satan, and
which they now defend by clamours, and fue, and sword; that
when we offer up Christ to his Father, in the sacrifice of the
mass, we, by that aet os oblation, obtain remissiori os sius, and
become partakers of the passion of Christ. What remeius, then,
to the passion os Christ, but to be an example of redemption,
by which we may learn to be our own redeemers? Christ

himself, when he seals the assurance of pardon in the sacred
supper, does not command his disciples to rest in this act, but
refers thern to the sacrifice of his death; signifying that the
