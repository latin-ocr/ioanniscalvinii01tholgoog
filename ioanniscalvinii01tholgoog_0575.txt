XXXIV. Now, because Augustius is tha principal among
the ancient fathers who has asserted this point of doctrine,
that the sacraments sustain no diminution, and that the grace
which they represent is not frustrated by tha unbelief or
wiclredness of men, it will be usesul to adduce hia own worda,
which will clearly prove that those who exposa the body of
Christ to be caten by dogs, (a) are chargeable with au injudi-
cious and culpable perversiori of his meaning, in applying it bo
the present argument. Sacramental eating, according bo them,
is that by which the wicked receive the body and blood of
Christ without any iuduence os his Spirit, or any effect os hia
grace. Augustine, on the contrary, carciully examining these
words, ‘⁶ Whoso eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood hath
etemal lise,'’ (b) says, “This is the virtue os the sacrament,
uot the mere visible sacrament ; and that intemally, not exten

froin which he concludes that the sacrament oi tha uuion
which we heva with the body arrd blood os Christ, is presented
in the sacred supper, to some to life, to others to perdition3
but that the thing siguified by the sacrament is only given to
liseto all who partalre os it, and in uo case to perdition 'uo
preclude any cavil here, that the thing signified is rrot the body,
but the grace of the Spirit, which may be separated from the
body, hc obviares such misrepresentations by thause of the
contrasted epithets os visible and rancidi& for the body us
Ohrist cannot be comprehended under the former. Hence it
follows, that unbelievers receive nothing but the visible symbol.
And, sor the more complete removal of every doubt, after having
said that this breadrequires the hunger of the inner man, he
adds, “ Moses, and Aaron, and Phinehas, and many others who
ate the manna, were acceptable to God. Why? Because they
spiritually understood the visible sood, they spiritually hungered,
