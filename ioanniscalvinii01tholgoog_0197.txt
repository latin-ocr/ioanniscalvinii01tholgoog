But perhaps they will plead, that these passages refer to that
ignorauce οι the true God, iu which they acknowledge the
elect to be involved previously to their calling Though this
would be an impudent cavil, since the apostle's inserences from
them are atich as these: “Put away lying3 aud let him that
stole, steal uo more.”(q) But what will they reply to other
passages? such as that where, aster declariug to the Corinthi·
ans, that ‘⁴ Neither fornicatore, nor idolaters, nor adulterare,
nor effeminate, nor abusers os themselves with mankind, nor
thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extor-
tiouers, shall inherit the kingdom οι God;” be immediately
adds, “And such were some oi you; but ye are washed, but
ye are sanctified, bnt ye are justified iu the name οι the Lord
Jesus, eud by the Spirit of our God.'’ (r) And another pes·
sege, addressed ιο the Romans: “As ye have yielded your
members servants ιο uncleauness, aud to iniquity nuto ini·
quity3 even se now yield your members servants ιο right·

So likewise the persons whom Peter addressed, he ought to
have exhorted ιο gratitnde on account ol the perpetual seed
of electiou. But, ou the contrary, he admouishes them,‘ ‘that
the time past may suffice to have wrought the will οι the
Gentilesst' (t) What if we come ιο particular examples?
What principle os righteousness was there iu Rahab the
harlot before saith?(n) ιιι Manasseh, wheu Jerusalem was
dyed, and almost drowued, with the blood os the propheta? (r r)
in the thies, who repented in his dying momenta? (y) Away,
theu, with these arguments, which men οι presumptuous curi·
osity raise to themselves without regarding the Scriptura. Let
us rather abide by the declaration of the Scriptura, that “all
we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to
his own way,’ '(z) thetis, destruction. Those whom the Lord
has determined to rescue from this gnlf of perdition, he defers
