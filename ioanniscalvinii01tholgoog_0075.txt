indeed, apprehend the good things which they use to bc from
God, whom they preise in bis works; but not being persuaded
that they are given ιο them, how cordd they give thanlrs to
God as the givcr of them? We see, in short, the tendency of
this liberty, which is, that without any scruple of conscience οι
perturbation of mind, we should devote the gifts cf God to that
use for which he bas given them; by which confidence our
souls may heve peace with him, and eclrnowledgc his liberality
towards us. For this comprehende all ceremonies, the observa·

IX. Now, it must be carefullyobserved, that Christian liberty
is in all its branches a spiritual thing, all the virtue of which

desire a praeminente in every specics of luxury3 who does not

aredefended under the prctcxt of Christian liberty. They allege
that they are things indifferent3 this 1 admit, provided they be
indifferently used. But where they are ιοο ardently coveted,
proudly boasted, or luxuriously lavished, these things, of them·

respecting things which are indifferent: “Unto the pure all
