to him are none os them gratuitous, but merely the performance
of indispensable duties; and that justly; sor we are servants
under such numerous obligations as we could never discharge;
even though all our thoughts and all our members were devoted
to the duties of the law. In saying, therefore, “When ye shall
have done all those things which are commanded,” he supposes
acasc os one man having attained to a degree of righteousness
beyond what is attained by all the meu in the world. How,
then, while every one of us is at the greatest distance from this
point, can we presume to glory that we have completely attained
to that perfect standard? Nor can any one reasonably object,
that there is nothing to prevent his efforts from going beyond
his necessary obligations, who in any respect falls os doing the
duty incumbent on him. For we must aclmowledge, that we
cannot imagine any thing pertaining either to the service ol
God or to the love of our neighbour, which is not comprehend-
edin the Divine law. But if it isa partos the law, let us not
boast os voluntary liberality, where we are bound by necessity.
XV. Itis irrelevant to this subject, to allege the boasting
of Paul, (a) that among the Corinthians he voluntarily receded
from what, is he had chosen, he might have claimed as his
right, and not only did what was incumbent on him to do,
bnt afforded thern his gratuitous services beyond the requisi· ,
tions of duty. They ought to attend to the reason there as·
signed, that he acted thus, “lest he should hinder the gospel
os Christ.'’ (to) For wlcked and fraudulent teachers recom-
mended themselves by this stratagem of liberality, by which
they endeavoured, both to conciliate a favourable reception to
their own pernicious dogmas, and to fix an odium on the gos·
- pel, so that Paul was necessitated either to endanger the doc-
trine os Christ, or to oppose these artifices. Now, if it be a
matter of indifference to a Christian to incur an offence when
he may avoid it,I consess that the apostle performed sor the
Lord a work of supererogation; but if this was justly required
os a prudent minister os the gospel, l maintain that he did
what was his duty to do. Eveu if no such reason appeared,
yet the observation os Chrysostom is always true —that all that
we'have is on the same tennre astho possessione ofslaves,
which the law proaounces to be the property of their masters.
And Christ has clearly delivered the samo truth in the parable,
where he inquires whether we thank a servant, when he re·
'turns horne in the evening, after the various labours of the
day. (a) But it is possible that he may have laboured with

greater diligence than we had ventured to require. This may
be granted, yet he has done uo more than, by the condition
