when he calls it dead. But his meaning may be sufficientty
understood from the definition he gives: “Thou believest,”
says he, “that there is one God.'’ lndeed, if nothing ba con·
taiued in this creed but a belief of the Divine existence, it is
not at all surprising that it is inadequate to justification. And
we must not suppose this deuial to be derogatory to Christian
faith, the nature of which is widely different. For how does
true saith justify, but by uniting usto Christ, that, being made
one with him, we may participate his righteousness? lt does
not, therefore, justify us, by attaining a knowledge of God's
existence, but by a reliance on the certainty of his mercy.

XII. But we shall not have ascertained the whole scope of
the apostle, till we have exposed the other fallacy; for he at·
tributos justification partly to works. If we wish to make
James consistent with the rest of the Scriptures, and even with
himself, we must understand the word “ justify ” ina different
signification from that in which it is used by Paul. Forwe are
said by Paul to be justified, when the memory of our unright·
eousness is obliterated, and we are accounted righteous. lf
James had alluded to this, it would have been preposterous for
him to make that quotation from Moses: “ Abraham believed
God,'’ dte. (o) For he introduces it in the following manner:
Abraham obtained righteousness by works, because he hesitated
not to sacrifice his son at the command of God. And thus was
the Scriptura fulfilled, which saith, Abmham believed God, and
it was imputed unto him for righteousness. lf an effect ante·
cedent to its cause be an absurdity, either Moses falsely asserta
in that place, that Abraham‘s saith was imputed to him sor
righteousness, or Abraham did not obtain righteousness by his
obedience, displayed in the oblation of his son. Abraham was
justified by saith, while Ishmael‚ who arrived at adolescence
before the birth of Isaac, was not yet conceived. How, then,
can we ascribe his justification to au act of obedience performed
so long aster? Wherefore, either James irnproperly inverted
the order of events, (which it is uulawful to imagine) or, by
saying that Abraham was justified, he did not mean that the
patriarch deserved to be accounted righteous. What, then, was
his meaning? He evidently appears to spealr of a declaration
of righteousness before men, and not of an imputation of it in
the sight of God3 as though he had said, 'l'hey who are jus·
tified by true faith‚ prove their justification, not bya barren
and irnaginary resemblance of saith, but by obedience and good
works. In a word, he is not disputing concerning the method

of justification, but requiring of believers a righteousness
manifested iu good works. And as Paul contenda for justi·
