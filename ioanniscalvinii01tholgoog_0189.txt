IV. As it is erroneous, therefore, to snspend the efficacy of
election upon the saith of the gospel, by which we discover ⁹
onr interest in election, so we shall observa the best order, if,
in seckingen assurance of our election, we confine onr atten-
tion to those subsequent signs which are certain attestations of
it. Satan never attacks believers witha more grievous or
dangerous temptation, than when he disqniets them with
doubts of their electiori, and stimulates to au improper desire
of secking it ina wrong way. loall it secking in a wrong
way, when miserable man endeavours to force his way into the
secret recesses of Divine wisdom‚ and to penetrate even to the
highest eternity, that he may discover what is determined con·
cerning him at the tribunal of God. Theo he precipitates
himself to be absorbed in the profonnd of an unfathomable
gulf3 then he entangles himself in numberless and mextricable
snares3 then he sinlrs himself inanabyssof total darkness For
it is right that the folly of the human mind should be thus
punished with horrible destruction, when it attempts by its own
ability to rise to the summit of Divine wisdom. This tempta·
tion is the more fatal, because there is no other to which men
in general have a stronger propensity. For there isscarcely a
person to be found, whose mind is not sometimes struclr with
this thought -Whence can you obtain salvation but from the
election of God? And what revelation have you received of
electioni If this has once impressed a man, it either perpetu·
ally excruciatas the unhappy being with dreadful tormenta,
or altogether stupefies him with astonishment. Indead, 1
should desire no stronger argument to prove how extremely
erroneous the conceptions of such persons are respectiug pre·
destination, than experience itself; since no error can effect
the mind, more pestilent than such as disturbs the conscience,
and destroys its peace aud tranquillity towards God. There·
fore, if we dread shipwreclr, let us anxiously bewara of this
rock, on which none ever strilre without being destroyed.
But though the discussion of predestination may be compared
to a dangerous ocean, yet, in traversiug over it, the navigation
is safe and serene, and 1 will also add pleasant, unless any one
freely wishes to exposa himself to danger. Foras those who,
in order to gain an essurance of their electiori, examine into
the eternal counsel of God without the word, plunge them·
selvas into a fatal abyss, so they who investigate it in a regular
and orderly manner, as it is contained in the word, derive
from such inquiry the benedt of peculim consolation. Lot this,
then, be our way of inquiry 3 to begin aud end with the calling

of God. Though this prevents not believers from perceiv-
ing, that the blessings they daily receive from the haud ot God
