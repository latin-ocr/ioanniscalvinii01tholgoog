lX. 1 proceed 101110 seculare, 01 whom some are called 10ηο
fician'es, thetis, they have benefices by which they are main-
tained3 others hire themselves to labour by 1110 day, in saying
messor singing, and live on the wages which they gain from
these employments. Benefices are either attended with cure 01
souls, as bishoprics and parishes; or they arethe stipends 01
delicate men, who gain a livelihood by chanting, as prebends,
canonries, dignities, cbaplainships, and the like. But in the
confusion which has been introduced, abbeys and priories are
conferred not only on 00011101 priests, but also on boys, by
privilege, that is, by common and ordinary custom. As to the
mercenaries, who seek their daily sustenance, how could they
act otherwise than they do, that is, 10 offer themselves to hire
in a mean and shameful manner; especially among such a vast
multitude 00 now swarms in the world? Therel'ore, when
they are ashamed 01 open begging‚ or think they should gain
but little by 11101 practice, they run about like hungry dogs,
11111 by their importunity, as by barking, 0111011 110111 1011101οι11
hands some morsele to put into their mouths. Here ir 1 should
endeavour 10 describe what a grem disgrace it is to 1110 Cburch,
11101 the office and dignity 01 the presbytery hasbeen so de·
graded, there would be no end. My readers, therefore, have
1101000011 10 expect from me a long discourse, corresponding to
such a flagitious enormity. 1 only assert, in few words, 11101
ir it be the duty 01 0 presbyter, 00 the word 01 God prescribes,
andthe ancient 0011000 require, 10 seed the Ohurch and adminis-
ter the spiritual kingdom 01 Christ,(l) all those priests who
bave no work or weges, except in making merchandise 01
11100000, 1101 only fail 01 executing their office, but have no
legitimate 011100 10 01100010. For there is no place assigned to
1110111 10 teach; they have no people to govern. 111 short,
nothing 1011101111 10 1110111 11111 the 01101 upon which to 01101 up
(1111101111 sacrifice; and this 10 1101 sacrificing to God, but 10
demens, as we shall 000 111 another place.

X. Here 1 touch not on the external vices, but only on thc
intestine evil which is deeply rooted in their institution, and
cannot be separated from it. 1 shall adda remark, which will
1011111111010111)7 in their ears, but because it is true, it must be
expressed -that canons, deans, chaplains, provests, and all who
are supported by sinecures, are to be considered in 1110001110
light. For what service can they perform 101 the Church?
They have discarded the preaching 01 the word, the superin-
tendence 01 discipline, and the administration 01 the sacramente,
as employments attended with 100 much labour and trouble.
What have they remaining, then, to boast 01 as true presbytersl
