views to many other things; or that while they were occupied
with more weighty and serious concems‚ things oi inferior
moment escaped their notice; or merely that, being men, they
were liahle to ignorance arrd error; or that they were some·
times hurried into precipitancy by the violence of their passions.
Os the truth os the last observation, which seems the severest
of all, there is a remarkable example in the Council os Nice3
the dignity os which has been universally and justly held in
the highest veneration. For though the principal article of our
saith was endangered, and they had to contend with Arius, the
enemy of it, who was there in readiness sor the contest,-though
it was of the greatest importance that harmony should be
maintained among those who came with adesign to consuta
the errores Arius, —notwithstanding that, careless os such great
dangers, sorgetful of gravity, modesty‚ and every thing lilre
good manners, dropping the controversy between them, as if
they had assembled with an express view to the gratification
os Arius, they began to counteract themselves with intestine
dissensions, and to direct against each other the pen which
ought to have been employed against Arius. 'Phe foulest ac*-
cusations were heard, defamatory libels were circulated, and
there would have been no end of the contentione till they had
murdered one another, if it had not been for the interference
os the emperor Constantine, who protested that a scrutiny into
their lives was a thing beyond his cognizance‚ and repressed
this intemperate conduct with pmise rather than with censure.
ln how many instanccs is it probable that errors were committed
by other succeeding councils? Nor does this require any long
proos3 sor whoever peruses their acts, will discover many in·
firmities, not to mention any thing worse.

Xl. And leo, the Roman pontiti, hesitates not to bringa
charge of ambition and inconsiderate temerity against the
Oouucil os Chalcedon, which he at the same time acknowledges
to have been orthodox in points os doctrine. He does not
deny it to have been a legitimate council, but he unequivocally
asserts that it was possible for it to err. 1t may be thought,
perhaps, that lbetray a wantos judgment in taking pains to
point out such errors; since our adversaries consess that coun-
cils might err in things not essential to salvation. This labour,
however, is not unnecessary. For though they find thern-
selves obliged to confess this in words, yet when they obtrude
upon us the decision of every council on every subject, without
any discrimination, as an oracle of the Holy spirit, they re·
qurre os us, in fact, more than they had first assumed. Whatis
the lauguage of such conduct, but that coancils cannot err, or
that, if they do err, it is unlawful forus to discover the truth, or
to resuse assent to errore? And l intend to draw no other
