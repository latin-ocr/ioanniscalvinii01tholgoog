consider the last words of dying persons as oracular. Christ,
at the moment of his death, declared that by his own sacrifice
every thing necessary to our salvation had been accomplished
and finished. To such a sacrifice, the perfection of which he
so explicitly declares, shall it be lawful for usto make innume· ·
rable additions every day, as though it were imperfect? While
God’s most holy word not only affirms, but proclaims and
protests, that this sacrifice was once perfect, and that its virtue
is eternal,—do not they who require another sacrifice charge
this with imperfectiori and inefficacy? But whatis the ten-
dency of the mass, which admits of a hundred thousand sacri·
fices being offered every day, except it be to obscure and sup-
press the passion of Christ, by which he offered himself as the
alone sacrifice to the Father? Who, that is not blind, does
not see that such an opposition to the clear and manifest tnrth
must have arisen from the audacity of Satan? lam aware of
the fallacies with which that father of falschood is accustomed
to varnish over this fraud ; as, that these are not various or
different sacrifices, but onlya repetition of that one sacrifice.
But such illusions are easily dissipated. For, through the
whole argument, the apostle is contending, not only that there
are no other sacrifices, but that that one sacrifice was offered
once, and is never to be repeated. 'I'he more artful sophistcrs
have recourse to a deeper subterfuge; that the mass is not a
repetition of that sacrifice, but an application of it. This soph·
istry also may be confuted, without any more difficulty than the
former. For Christ once offered up himself, not that his sac·
rifice might be daily ratificd by new oblations, but that the
benefit of it might be communicated to us by the preaching
of the gospel, and the administration of the sacred supper.
Thus Paul says that “Christ our passover is saerifioed for us,'’
and commanda us to feast on him. (b) This, 1 say, is the way
in which the sacrifice of the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ is
rightly applied to us, when itis communicated to ns for our
enjoyment, and we receive it with true faith.

lV. But it is worth while to hear on what other foundation
they rest the sacrifice of the mass. They apply to this
purpose the prophecy of Malachi, in which the Lord promises,
that “from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of
the same, incense shall be offered nnto ” his “name, and epure
offering.” (o) As though it were a new or unusual thing for
the prophete, when they speak of the calling of the Gentiles,
to designate the spiritual worship of God, to which they exhort
them, by the external ceremonies of the law ; in order to show,
in a more familiar manner, to the men of their own times, that
