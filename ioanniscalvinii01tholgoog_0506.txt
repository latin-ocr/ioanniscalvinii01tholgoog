forgiven, be baptized. For in baptism the Lord promises re·
mission of sins3 receive this and be secure.” lt is not my
design, however, to diminish the efficacy of baptism 3 but the ·
substance and truth accompanies the sign, as God works by
external means. Nevertheless, from this sacrament, as from
all others, we obtain nothing except what we receive by saith.
If faith be wanting, it will be a testimony of our ingratitude,
to render us guilty before God, because we have not believed
the promise given in the sacrament, but as baptism is a sign of
our confession, we ought to testify by it, that our confidence
is in the mercy of God, and our purity in the remission of sins,
which is obtained for us by Jesus Christ3 and that we enter
into the Ohurch of God in order to live in the same hannony

of saith and charity, of one mind with all the faithful. This ¹

is what Paul meant when he said, that “ by one Spirit we are
all baptized into one body.’' (s)

XVI. Now, if it be true, as we have stated, that a sacrament
is to be considered as received, not so much from the hand of
him by whom it is administered, as from the hand of God
himself, from whom, without doubt, it proceeded, we may con·
clude that it is not capable of any addition or diminution from
the dignity of the person by whose hand it is delivered. And
as, among men, if a letter be sent, provided the hand and seul
of the writer be known, it is of very little importance who and
what the carrier of it may be, so it ought to be sufficient
for us to know the hand and seal of our Lord in his sacra-
ments, by whatever messenger they may be conveyed. This
fully refutes the error of the Donatista, who measured the
virtue and value of the sacrament by the werthiness of the
minister. Such, in the present day, are our Anabaptists, who
positively deny that we arc rightly baptizcd, because we were
baptized by impious and idolatrous ministers in the kingdom
of the pope, and therefore violently urge us to be baptized

notin the name of any man, but in the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and consequently that
it is not the baptismos man, but of God, by whomsoever it is
administered. Though those who baptized us were charge·
able with the grossest ignorance or contempt of God and of
all religion, yet they did not baptiza us into the fellowship of
their own ignorance or sacrilege, but into the faith of Jesus
Christ3 because they invoked, not their own name, but the
name of God, and baptized in no othername bathis. Now,
ifit was the baptism of God, it certainly contained the promise
