destitute of common sense as to make that one case an exception
to a law, to guard against which every one sees that the law was
made? For the counoil, in condemning appeals beyond tbe
sea, only prohibited any one from appealing to Rome; and this
admirable expositor excepta Rome from the general prohibition!

X. But to put an end at once to this question, a single trans-
action, related by Augustine, will be sufficient to show what
kind of jurisdiction was anciently possessed by the bishop of
Rome. Donatus, bishop of Casae Nigrae, had aceused Caecili-
anus, bishop of Carthage. 'I'he accused was condemned with·
out a hearing3 for, knowing that the bishops had conspired
against him, he would not appear. The matter was then
brought before the Emperor Constantine. With aview to have
the catrse decided by an ecclesiastical judgment, he referred tha
cognizance of it to Melchiades, bishop of Rome, with whom
he associated some other bishops from Italy, Franco, aad Spain.
If it was partos the ordinary jurisdiction of the see of Rome to
hear an appeal in an ecclesiastical cause, why did Melchiades
suffer any colleagues to be appointed with him at the pleasura
of the Emperor? and, moreover‚ why did he himself undertake
the business rather at the command of the Emperor than from
his own authority? But let us hear what took placa after·
wards. Caecilianus was victorious. Donatus of Casae Nigrae
was convicted of calumny. He appealad. Constantine re·
sarred the appeal to the bishop of Arles. He sat in judgment
on the decision of the bishop of Rome. If the Roman see pos·
sessed the supreme jurisdiction‚ subject to no appeal, how did
Melchiades submit to such au insult, as for the bishop of Arles
to be preferred before him? And who was the Emperor that
did this? It was Constantine the Great, of whom they boast
that he not only devoted all his attention, but employed almost
all the power of his empire, to exalt the dignity of their see. We
see, then, how very far the bishop of Rome was at that time
from that supreme dominion which ha pretends to have been
given him by Christ over all Charches, and which he falsely
boasts of having exercised in alleges with tha consent of the
whole world.

XI. Ι know what numerous epistles, and rescripta, and
edicta, theream, in which the pontifl's have confidently ad·
vanced the most extravagant claims respecting this power.
But it is also known to every person, possessed of the least
sense or learning, that most things contained in them. are so err·
tremely absurd, that it is easy to discover at the first glauce
from what source they have proceeded. For what manos
sound judgment‚ and in his sober sensas, can suppose that
Anacletua was the author of that curicus interpretation, which
Gratiap quotes under his name -that Gephas means a head?
