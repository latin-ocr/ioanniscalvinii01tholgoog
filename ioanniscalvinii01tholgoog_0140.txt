The objection ofsorne, that in wishing the advent ot⁴ God’s king·

dom, we desire at the same time the abolition of sin, is too
puerile; because, in the first part of the prayer, we have an ex·
bibition of the highest perfectiori, but here of infinnity. Thus
these two things are perfectly consistent, that in aspiring to-
wards the mark we may not neglect the rcmedies required by
our necessity. Lastly, we pray that we rnay be forgiven ns
wr ronorva oue neerons; that is, as we forgive and pardon
all who have ever injured us, either by unjust actious or by
contumelious language. Not that it is our province to forgive
the guilt ot⁴ sin and transgression3 this is the prerogative of
God alone: our forgiveness consists in divesting thc mind ot⁴
anger, enmity, and desire of revenge, and losing the memory
of injuries by a voluntary sorgetfulness. Wherefore we must
not pray to God for forgiveness of sins, unless we also forgive
all the offences and injuries of others against us, either present
or past. But if we retain any enmities in our minds, meditate
acts of revenge, and seek opportunities of annoyance, and even
if we do not endeavour to obtain reconciliation with our ene·
mies, to oblige them by all kind offices, and to render them
our friends, - we besecch God, by this petition, not to grant us
remissiones sins. For we supplicate him to grant to us what we
grant to others. This is praying him not to grant it tous, unless
we grant it also. What do persons of this description gaiu by
their prayers but a heavier judgment? Lastly, it must be
observed‚ that this is not a condition, that he would forgive us
aa we forgive our debtors, because we can merit his forgive·
ness of us by our forgiveness of others, as though it described
the cause of his forgiveness; but, by this expression, the Lord
intended, partly to comfort the weakness of our faith3 for he
has added this as a sign, that we may be as certainly assured
of remission of sins being granted us by him, as we are certain
and conscious of our granting it to others; if, attho same time,
our minds be freed and purified from all hatred, envy, and re·
vengc3 partly by this, as a criterion, he expungas from the
number of his children, those who, hasty to revenge and
difficult to forgive, maintain inveterate enmities, and cherish
in their own hearts towards others, that indignation which
they deprecate from themselves, that they may not presume to
invoke him as their Father. Which is also clearly expressed
by Luke in Christ's own words.

XLVI. The sixth petition is, Lern us nor rnre reurre-
rrou, aur nrarvrn us reon evin. This, as we have said, corre·
sponda to the promise respecting the law of God to be engraven
in our hearts. But became our obedience to God is not with·
out continual warfare, and severe and arduous conflicta, we here
pray for arms, and assistance to enable us to gain the victory.
