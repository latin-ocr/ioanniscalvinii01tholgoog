shall wonder.’'(q) Again: “ The law shall perish 110111 the
priest, and counsel 110111 the ancients.’' (r) Again: “Night shall
be 11010 you, that ye shall not have avision, aud it shall be dart
ttnto you,that ye shall 1101 divine ; and the sun shall go down over
the prophete, and the day shall be darlr over them.” (s) Now, 11
these priests and prophets had all been collected together, what
spirit would have presided in their assembly? This is remark-
“ ably exemplified in the conncil convolted by Ahab. Fonr
hundred prophete were present. But because they were as-
sembled with 110 other intention than to datter that impions
monarch, Satan was sent by the Lord to be a lying spirit in all
their mouths.(t) There the truth 'was rejected with one Δ
consent; Micaiah was condemned as a heretis, beaten, and
cast into prison. Jeremiah received the same treatment, and
other prophete experieneed similar injustice.

VII But one example, which is more memorable than the
rest, may suffice as aspecimen 01 all. 111 the council which the
chief priests and Pharisees convened at Jerusalem against Christ,
what was there wanting in point 01 external 1011111 For 11 there
had then been no Church at Jerusalem, Christ would never have
united in their sacrifices and other ceremonies A solemn sum·
mons was issned; the high priest presided; all the priests attend-
etlt yet there Christ was condemned, and his doctrine rejected.
This act proves that the Church was not contained in 11181
council. But, it will be said, there is no danger 01811011 8 01101110·
stance happening to us. Who has assured us 01 this? For to
be too confident in a matter 01 such great importance, is culpable
stupidity. But while the Spirit has expressly predicted, by the
mouth 01 Paul, 11181 there shall come 811 apostasy, which cannot
take place without the pastors being the first torevolt from God, (v)
why do we wilsully shut onr eyes 10 our own ruini Where-
1018 11 18 by no means 10 be conceded, that the Ohurch consiste
111 the assembly 01 the pastors, respecting whom God has nowhere
promised that they should always be good, but, 011 the contrary,
1188 denounced that they would sometimes be wicked. Now,
when he warns us 01 a danger, his design is to 1118118 118 111018

that all couneils ought to be condemned, or that all their acts
ought to be rescinded and cancelled at once. Stilll shall be
