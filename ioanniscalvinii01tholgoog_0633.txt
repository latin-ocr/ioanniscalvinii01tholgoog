Priscilla, and there is some uncertainty even respecting
Aquila3 for that tonsure may as well be referred to Paul as
to Aquila. (g) But not to leave them what they require, that
they have an example of this tonsure in Paul, it ought to be
observed by the plain reader, that Paul never shaved his head
with a view to any sanctity, but merely to accommodate him-
self to the weakness of his brethren. l am accustomed to call
vows of this kind vows of charity, and not of piety; that is to
say, they were not made for arry purpose of religion, or as acts
of service to God, but in order to bear the ignorance of weak
brethren; as the apostle himself says: “ Unto the Jews l be-
came as a lew, that Ι might gaiu the Jews’' (t) Therefore be
did this act, and that once, and for a short period, that he
might accommodate himself to the Jews. When these men
desire, without any cause, to imitate the purificatione of the
Nazarite3‚ what is this but raising upa new Judaism by a
culpable affectation of emulatiug that which is abolished? The
same superstition dictated that decretal epistle which prohibite
ecclesiastics, according to the apostle, to let their hair grow,
but enjoins them to shave in a circulor form; as though the
apostle, when he mentioned what is becoming to all men, were
concerned about the circular tonsure of the clergy. Hence
the readers may form some opinion of the importance aud
dignity of other succeeding mysteries, to which there is such
an introduction.

XXVII. The true origin of the clerical tonsure is very
evident from the testimony of Augustine. As, in that age, no
persons suffered their hair to grow long, but such as were
effeminate, and affected an elegance and delicacy not sufficient·
ly manly, it was thought that it would be a bad example to
permit this custom in the clergy. They were, therefore,
commanded to shave their heads, that they might exhibit no
appearance of effeminate ornament. The tonsure then became
so common, that some monlrs, to display their superior sanctity
by something remarkable and distinguished from otherS, left
their hair to grow very long. Afterwards, when the custom
of wearing long hair was revived, and several nations were
converted to Christianity, who had always been accustomed to
wear their hair, as France, Germany, and England, it is probable
that eeclesiastics every where shaved their heads, that they
might not appear to be fond of the ornament of hair. At
length, in a more corrupt age, when all the ancient institutions
were either perverted or degenerated into superstition, because
they saw no reason iu the clerical tonsure (for they had re-
tained nothing but a foolish imitation of their predecessors,)
they had recourse to a mystery, which they now superstitiously
