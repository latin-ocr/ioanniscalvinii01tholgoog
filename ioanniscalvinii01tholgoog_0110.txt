and in general Christ is totally neglected, and God is addressed
through their names. ls not this transferring to them 11161
office of exclusive intercession, which we have before asserted
to be peculiar to Christ l Again, who, either angel or demon,
ever uttered to any of the human 1666 6 syllable eonoeming
such an intercession 66 they pretend? for 1116 Scripture is
perfectly silent respecting any such thing. What reason, then,
was there 161 116 invention? Certainly, when 1116 human mind
thus seeks assistances 161 itself, in which it is not warranted
by the word 61 God, it evidently betrays its want of saith.
Now, if we appeal to the consciences 61 611 the advocates for the
intercession of saints, we shall find that the only cause 61 11 is,
an anxiety in their minds, 66 11 Christ could fail of success, or
be too severe in this business. By which perplexity they, in
the first place, dishonour Christ, aud rob him os the character
of 1116 only Mediator, which, as it hes been given by the Father
66 his peculiar prerogative, ought therefore not to be 116116-
ferred to any other. And by this very conduct they obscure
' the glory 61 his nativity, and frustrate the benefit of his cross3
in a word, they divest and defraud him 61 the praise which is
due to him 161611 his 66116116 61111 611 1116 sufferings3 since the
end of them all is, that 116 may really be, and be accounted,
the sole Mediator. They ut the sometime reject 1116 gooduess
61 God, who exhibits himself 66 their Father3 sor he is not a
father to them, unless they acknowledge Christ as their brother.
Which they plainly deny, unless they believe themselves to be
the objects 61 his fratemal affection, than which nothing 6611 be
more mild or 16111161. Wheresore 1116 Scripture offers him alone
to us, sends us to him, and fixes us in him. “ He,'’ says Am·
brose, “is our mouth, with which we address the Father3 our
eye, by which we behold the Father; our right hand, by which
we present ourselves to 1116 Father. Witbout whose mediation,
neither we, nor any of all the saints, have the least intercourse
with God.‘’ 11 they reply, 11161 the public prayers in the
churches are finished by this conclusion, “through Christ our
Lord,'' it is a frivolous subterfuge, because the intercession of
Christ is 1161 less profaned when it is confounded with the
prayers aud merits of the dead, than 11 11 were wholly omitted,
and the dead alone mentioned. 86611166, 111 611 their litanies,
both verse and prose, where every honour is ascribed to dead
saints, there is no mention of Christ.

XXll. But their folly rises to such a pitch, that we have
here 6 striking view of the genius 61 superstition, which, when
it has 61166 61161166 off the reins, places in general no limitato
