lence; but of the possession or fruition of ultimate blessedness,
aa the very words of Christ import—“ in the world to come,
eternal life.’' (c) And in another place, “Come, inherit the
kingdom,'' dcc. (d) For the same reason, Paul applies the
term adoption to the revelation of adoption, which shall be
made in the resurrection ; and afterwards explains it to be
“the redemption of our body.'’ (e) Otherwise, as alienation
from God is eternal death, so when a man is received into the
favour of God so as to enjoy communion with him and become
united to him, he is translated from death to life3 which is
solely the fruit of adoption. And is they insist, with their ac·
customed pertinacity, on the reward of werke, we may vetort
against them thet passage of Peter, where eternal life is called
“ the end (or reward) of faith.'' (s)

IV. Let us not, therefore, imagine, that the Holy Spirit by
these promises commenda the werthiness of our worlrs, aa
though they merited such a reward. For the Scriptura leaves
us nothing that can exalt us in the Divina presence. lta whole
tendency is rather to repress our arrogance, and to inspira us
with humility, dejection, and contrition. But such promises
assist our wealrnesa, which otherwise would immediately slide
and fall, if it did not sustain itself by this expectation, aad al·
leviate its sorrows by this consolation. First, let every one re·
flect, how difficult it is for a men to relinquish and renounce,
not only all that belongs to him, but even himself. And yet
thiais the first lesson which Christ teaches his disciples, that
. isto say, all the picus. afterwards he gives them such tuition
during the remainder of their lives, under the discipline of the
cross, that their hearts may not fix either their desires or their
dependence on present advantages. ln short, he generally ma·
nages them in such a manner, that whithersoever they turn
their views throughout the world, nothing but despair presente
itself to them on every side3 so that Paul says, “ lf in this life
only we have hope in Christ, we are of all men most mise-
rable.'' (g) To preserve them from sinlring under these afflic-
tione, they have the presence of the Lora, who encourages
them to mise their heads higher, and to extend their vicws
further, by assurances that they will find in him that hlessed·
ness which they cannot see in the world. 'l'his blessedness
he calls a reward, a recompense; not attributing any merit
to their works, but signifying that it is a compensation for
tlreir oppressione, sufferings, and disgrace. Wherefore there

is no objection against our following the example os the Scrip· .
