arch himself was not cndued with such excellence as ιο acquire
the privilege of so grem an honour for himself and his poa·
terity. And the more effectually ιο demolish all pride, he
reproaches thern with having deserved no favour, being “ a stiff-
necked and rebellious people.’' (r) The prophete also fre·
quently reproach the Jews with the unwelcome mention of this
electiori, because they had shamefully depertcd from it. Let
thern, however, now corne forwerd, who wish ιο restrict the
election of God ιο the desert of men, or the merit of works.
When they see one nation preferred to all others, - when they
hear that God had no inducement ιο be more favourable to a
few, and ignoble, anderen disobedient and obstinate people, -
will they quarrel with him because he has chosen to give such
an example of mercy? But their obstreperous clamorrrs will
not impede his work, nor will tha reproaches they hurl against
Heaven, injure or effect his justice; they will rather recoil
upon their own beads. Tathis principle of the gracious cova

of God, in these words: “ Ο ye seed of Abraham his servant,
ye children of Jacob his chosen.’' And after having recountad
the continual benefits bestowed by God as fruita of eleanan, he
at length concludes that ha had acted with such liberality, “ be·
causa he remembered his covenant’' (ι) consistent with this
doctrine is the song of the whole Ohurch: “ 'l'hy right hand,

thera the land, because thou hadst a favour uoto them.'' (u)
It must be observed that where mention is made of the land,
it is a visiblc symbol of the secret separation, which compre·
hands adoption. David, in another place, exhorta the people
to the same gratitudo: “ Blessed is the nation whose Godis
the Lord3 and the people whom he hath chosen for his own
inheritance.’'(c) Samuel animatas ιο a good hope: “The
Lord will not fossalta his people, for his great name’s sake;
