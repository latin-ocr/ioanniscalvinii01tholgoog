aud repentance, which alone can give them an admission to the
fellowship of the eovenant3 but that the infant children of
Christian parents, being admitted by God to the inheritauce of
the coveuaut as soon as they are born, are also to be admitted
to baptism. To this must be referred what is related by the
avangelista, that the people “ were baptized of John, confessing
their sins”(s)-an example which we think ought to be
followed in the present day. For if a Turk or heathen were
to oller himself to baptism, we would not hastily admit him to
that sacrament, without his having first made a confession to
the satisfaction of tha Church.

XXV. Moreover, they adduce the language of Christ, which
is recorded by John, and which they suppose to representa
present regeneration as requisite to baptism3 “Except a man
be born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the king·
dotn of God.'’ (t) See, they say, how baptism is called regene-
ration by the mouth of the Lord. When it is evident, then,
that infants are utterly incapable of regeneration‚ on what
pretence do we admit them to baptism, to which regeneration
is indispensably necessary? In the first place, they are da·
eeived in supposing that this passage refers to baptism, because
it mentions water. For, after Christ had declared to Nicodamus
the corruption of nature, and shown him the necessity of being
born again-because Nicodamus was dreaming of a second
corporeal birth, he here indicates the manner in which God
regenerates us, namely, by water and by the Spirit3 as if he
had said, by the spirit who, in the ablution and purification of
the sonls of believers, performs the office of water. l therefore
understand by “water and the Spirit,” simply, the Spirit who
is water. Nor is this a novel mode of expression, for it per-
fectly corresponds with that declaration of John the Baptist,
“He that cometh after me shall baptiza with the Holy Ghost
and with fire.'' (v) As to baptiza tot'tlt tlte Holy Spiret and
with sire, therefore, is to confer the Holy Spirit, who, in re·
generation, has the office and nature of lire, so to be born of
water aad os tlte Spirit is uo other than to receive that intlu-
ence of the Spirit, which does in the soul what water does on
the body. Ι know that others give a different interpretation,
but 1 have no doubt that this is the genuine sense; because
the intention of Christ is simply to teaeh that all must be di·
vested of their own nature, who aspira to the kingdom of hea-
ven. However, if we were desirous of imitating their cavils,
it would be easy for us, granting what they require, to retort
upon them, that baptism is prior to faith and repentance, be·
cause, in the words of Christ, water is mentioned before the
spirit. 1t is certain that this phrase denotes spiritual gifts3
