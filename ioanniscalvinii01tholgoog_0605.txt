guilt uras expiated before God, or they were symbols of Divina
worship and attestatious of devotion. This second class oom-
prehended three kinds of sacrifices: some were offered in a
way of supplicatim, to implore the favour of G0d; semein a
way of thanksgiving, to testify the gratitudo of the mind for
benefits received; and some as simple expressions of piety, to
reucw the confirmation os the covenant: to this class belonged
brrrrrt-ofleriugs aud drinlr-offerings‚ first-fruits aud peace-oller·
ings. Therefore let us also divide sacrifices into two kinds,
und for the salre of distinction call one the sacrifice os worship
and piety, because it consists in the veneration and service of
God, which hc demands and receives frorn believers; or it may
be called, if you prefer it, the samflee os thorrlrsgiviog ,¹ for it
is presented to God by none bnt persons who, loaded with his
immense bonefits, devote themselves and all their actions to
him iu return. The other may be called the sacrifice osprops'·
tiotion or expiation. A sacrifice of expiation is that which is
offered to appease the wrath of God, to satisfy his justice, and
thereby to purify and cleanse from sins, that the sinuat, de·
livered from the defilement of iniquity, and restored to the pu-
rity of righteousness, may be re·admitted to the favour of God.
This was tlre designation, under the law, of those victims
which were offered for the expiation of sins; not that they
were sufficient to effect the restoration of the favour of God, or
the obliteration os iniquity, but because they prefigured that
true sacrifice which at length was actually accomplished by
Christ alone ; by him alone, because it could be made by no
other; aud once for all, because the virtue and efficacy of that
one sacrifice is eternal ς as Christ himself declared, when he said,
“lt is finished ; '' (p) that is to say, whatever was necessary to
reconcile us to the Father, and to obtain remissiori of sins,

‘ righteousness‚ and salvation, was all affected and completed by

that one oblation of himself, which was so perfect as to leave
no room for any other sacrifice afterwards.

XIV. Wherefore, lconclude, that it is a most criminal insult,
and intolerrtble blasphemy, both against Christ himself, and
against the sacrifice which he completed on our behalf by his
death upon the cross, for any man to repeat any oblation with
a view to procura the pardon of sins, propitiata God, and obtain
righteousness. But what is the object of the mass, except it
be that by the meritos a new oblation we may be made parta-
hers os the passion os Christ? And that there might be no
limits to their folly, they have not been satisfied with aflirming
it to be a common sacrifice offered equally for the whole Ghureh,
without adding, that it was in their power to make a peculiar
