darive matter of rejoicing from the integrity of their con·
sciences‚ they only conclude, from the frnits of vocation, that
they have been adopted by the Lord as his children. The de-
claration of Solomon, that “ ln the fear of the Lord is strong
confidence 3 '' (b) and the protestation sometimes used by the
saints to obtain a favourable audience from the Lord, that
“they have walked before ” him “in truth and with a perfect
heart ; '' (i) these things have no concern in laying the foun-
dation for establishing the conscience; nor are they of any
valae, except as they are consequences of the Divina vocation.
For there nowhere exista that fear of God which can establish
a full assumes, and the saints arc conscious that their integrity
is yet accompanied with many relies of corruption. But as
the fruits of regeneration evincc that the Holy Spirit dwells in
them, this afforda them ample encouragement to expect the as-
sistance of God in all their necessities, because they experience
him to be their Fathcr in an affair of such vast importance.
And even this they cannot attain, unless they have first appre-
hended the Divina goodness, confirmed by no other assurance
but that of the promise. For if they begin to estimate it by
their good works, nothing will be weaker or more uncertain3
for, if their worka be estimated in themselves, their imperfectiori
will menace them with the wrath of God, as much as their
purity, however incomplete‚ testifies his benevolence. ln a
word, they deelare the benofits of God, but in such a way as
not to turn away from his gratuitous favour, in which Paul as·
sures us there is “ length, and breadth, and depth, and height; ”
as though he had said, Which way soever the picus turn their
views, how high soever they ascend, how widely soever they
explanate, yet they ought· not to go beyond the love os Christ,
but employ themselves wholly in meditating on it, because it
comprehends in itself all dimensione. Therefore he says that it
“passeth knowledge,'' and that when we know how much
Christ has loved us, we are “filled with all the fulness of
God.'’ (lc) So also in another place, when he glories that
believers are victorious in every conflict, he immediately adds,
as the reason of it, “through him that loved us.'’ ( l)

XX. We see now, that the confidence which the saints
have in their works is not auch as either ascribes any thing to
the merit of them, (since they view them only as the gifts of
God, in which they acknowledge his goodness, and as marks
of their erdling, whence they infer their election,) or derogates
the least from the gratuitous righteousness which we obtain in
Christ3 since it depends upon it, and cannot subsist without it.
