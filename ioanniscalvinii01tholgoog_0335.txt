common booty, so those worthy persons concerted together, that
Pepin should have the temporal and civil sovereignty after the
depositiones the rightful monach, and that Zachary should
be made the head over all bishops, and enjoy the spiritual power.
At first this was feeble, as is generally the case with new estab-
lirhments3 but it was afterwards confirmed by the authority of
Charlemagne, and almost from a similar cause; for he also was .
indebted to the Roman pontiff, for his exertions in raising him to
the dignity of emperor. Now, though it is probable that the
Churches, before that time, had in general been greatly disfigured,
it is evident that in Franco and Gemmny the ancient form of
the Church was then entirely obliterated. The archives of
the 'parliament of Paris still contain brief registers of those times,
which, in relating ecelesiastical events, make frequent mention

that fraud, circumvention, aud violence, were generally practised.
He says, that the judieial process which was then pursued
was execrable, and not only unbecoming of the Church, but
disgraceful to any civil court. He exclaims, that the Church
is full of ambitious men, and that there is not one who is any
more afraid of perpetratiug the most flagitious crimes, than
robbers in their den when they are distributing the plunder
which they have seined on the highway. “ Few,’' he says,
“regard the mouth of the legislator; they all look at his hands,
aud that not without cause, for those hands transact all that is
