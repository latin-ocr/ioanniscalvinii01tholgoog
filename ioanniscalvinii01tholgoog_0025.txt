cause, unless they mean altogether to renounce the authority
of the Scripture. Over the material and formal causes they
superinduco a false colouring; as if our own works were to
share the honour of them with saith arrd the righteousness of
Christ. But this also is contradicted by the Scriptura, which
affirms that Christis the sole author of our righteousuess and
life, and that this blessing of righteousness is enjoyed by faith
alone.

XVIII. 'I'he saints often confirm aud console themselves
with the remembrance of their own inrroeence aud iutegrity,
and sometimes even refrain not from proelaiming it. Now, this
is done for two reasous; either that, in comparing their good
cause with the bad cause of the impious, thoy darive from such
comperison an amurance of victory, not so much by the com·
