greater number, to represent him as absent. He was then absent,
I say, not as to his power, but with respect to the manner of
representing him. Therefore, to observa proper bonnds, it is
necessary to retain that paucity in number, that facility in
observance, that dignity in signification, which consists in sirn-
plicity. That this has not been done, it is scarcely necessary
to mention. The fact is visible to all.

XV. Here 1 forbear to remark the pernicions opinions with
which the minds of men are impresscd‚ that these ceremonies
of human invention are sacrifices by which God is justly ap
peased, by which sins are expiated, by which righteousness
and salvation are procured. lt will be denied that things
intrinsically good are corrupted by such adventitious errors,
since equal guilt of this kind may be incurred in the performance
of works commended by God. But it is more intolerable to
attribute so rnuch honour to works presumptuonsly devised
by the will of men, as to believe them to be meritoribus of
eternal lise. For works commanded by God obtain a reward,
because the Legislator himself accepts them asacts of obedience.
They derive their velue, therefore, not from their own dignity
or intrinsic merit, bnt from God's estimation of our obedience
to him. l speak here of that perfection of works which God
commands, but whichmen never attam. For the works of
the law which we perform, are only accepted through the
gratuitous goodness of God, our obedience in them being weak
and imperfect. Butas we are not here discussing the value of
works independent of Christ, let us drop this 'question With
regard to the present argument, l again repeat, that whatever
valne is attributed to works, they derivo from the consideration
of the obedience, which is alone regarded by God, as he declares
by the prophet: “I commanded not conceming burm-offerings
or sacrifices, but this thing I commanded, saying, Obey my
voice.'' (lt) Of works of humen device, be speaks in another
place. “ Whercfore do ye spend money for that which is not
breed?''(s') Again: “ln vain do they worship me by the
precepts of men.'' (lc) Our adversaries, therefore, can never
excuse themselves for suffering the unhappy people to seek in
those external fooleries a righteousness to present before God,
and to support them at the heavcnly tribunal. Besides, is it not
a fault deserving of severe reprehension, that they exhibit cere·
menies not understood, like the scenery of a stage or a magical
incantation? For it is certain that all ceremonias are corrupt
and pernicions, unless they direct men to Christ. Now, the
ceremonies practised in the Papacy have no connection with
doctrine: they confine men to mere signs, destitute of all

Signification- Lastly, so ingenious is cupidity, it is evident
