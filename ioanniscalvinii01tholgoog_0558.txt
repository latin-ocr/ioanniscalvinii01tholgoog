syllable in confirmation of their notioris? 'Phe objection which
they urge, from the improbability that Christ, when he was pre·
paring peculiar consolation for his disciples in seasons of adver-
sity, should express himself in enigmatical or obscure language,
is completely in our favour. For is it had not been understood
by the apostles, that the bread was called his body in a figura-
tive sense, because it was a symbol of his body, they would
undoubtedly have been disturbed about so monstrous a declara-
tion. Almost at the same moment, John states that they were
embarrassed and perplexed with every minute difficulty. They
who debated among themselves how Christ wasto go to the
Father, and were at a loss to know how he would depart from
this world; who could understand nothing that was said of
a heavenly Father, because they had not seen him 3 how could
they have been so ready to believe any thing so entirely repug-
nant to every dictate of reason, as that Christ was sitting at the
table before their· eyes, and yet was invisibly enclosed in the
bread? By eating the bread without any hesitation, they testi-
fied their consent, and hence it appears that they understood the
words of Christ in the same sense that we do, considering that it
is common in all sacraments for the name of the sign to be trans·
ferred to the thing signified. To the disciples, therefore, it was,
as it is to us, a certain and clear consolation, involved m no
errigma; nor is there any other cause to be assigned why some
reject our interpretation, except that the davil has blinded them
by his delusione, irr consequence of which they imagine enig-
matical obscurities, where a beautiful figure furuishes such an
obvious and natural meaning. Besides, if we rigidly adhere to
the letter, what Christ said of the bread would be inconsistent
y with what he said of the cup. He calls the bread Itis body, he
calls the wine Itis blood: either this must be a vain repetition,
or adistinction which separatas the body from the blood. lt
might be said of the cup, This is my body, as truly as of the
bread; and the converse of this proposition would be equally
correct, that the bread is his blood. If they reply, that we
ought to consider for what end or use the symbols were insti-
tuted, —this 1 aclmowledge; but it is impossible to free their,
error from this absurd consequence, that the bread is the blood,
and the wine the body. Now 1 am at a loss how to understand
them, when they admit the bread and the body to be different
things, and yet assert that the bread is properly and without
any figure called the body3 as if any one should say that a
garment is different from a man, and yet that it is properly
called a man. At the saure time, as if their victory consisted
iu obstinacy and calumny, they charge us with accnsing Christ
of falsehood, if we inquire into the true meaning of his words.
No'w, it will be easy for the readers to judge how unjnstly we
