Ghureh. We shall, first, spenlr os the common discipline to
which nll ought to be subject, and in the next plaoe we shall
proceed to the clergy, who, beside this common discipline, have
ι discipline peculiar to themselves. But es some have such n
hntred os discipline, es to abhor tho very name, they should
attend to tho following oonsidention: 'rhet is no society, and
even no house, though containing only a small family, can be
preserved in a proper siste without discipline, this is sar more
necessary in the Chureh, the state os which ought to be the
most orderly os ull. As the saving doctrine os Christ is the soni
os the Chureh, eo discipline forms the ligaments which connect
the members together, and keep ench in its proper place.
Whoever, therefore, either desire the ¹iilwliuon of all discipline,
or obstruet its restoration, whether they oct from design or
inadverteney, they certainly promote the entire dissolution ot
the Church. For what will be the consequence, is every man
be nt liberty to follow his own inclinatione? But such would
be rhe ease, unless the presehing of the doctrine were accom-
penied with private admonitione, reproofs, end other means to
enseree the doctrine, end prevent it from being altogether
ineffectual. Diseipline, therefore, serves as e bridle to cnrb
and restrain the refractury, who resist the doctrine of 0hrist;
or ne s spur ro stimulate the insutive5 end sometimes as n
father’s rod, with which those who have grievously fallen may
be ehestised in mercy, and with the gentleness or the Spirit of
Christ, Now, when we see the approach os certain beginnings
os u dreedsul desoletion in the Chureh, since there is no solici-
tude or means to keep the people in obedient-e to our Lord, ne-
cessity itself proclaims the went os a remedy ; end this is the
only remedy which has been commanded by Christ, or which
hus ever been adopted among ltuelievers⁴
