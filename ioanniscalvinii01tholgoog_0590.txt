been such as is now represented. lt is probable that the regu·
lation which he nrade was not ill calculated for the interest of
the Ghurch under the circumstances of those times. For there ο
is no doubt that the sacred supper was then set before the
faithful whenever they assembled for worship, nor is there
any more doubt that the principa} part of them used to com·
municate3 but as it would scarcely ever happen that all could
communicate together, and it was necessary that those who
were mixed with nubelicvers and idolaters, should testify their
faith by some exterual sign, -that holy man, for the sake of
order and discipline, appointed that day for all the Christiaus
at Rome to make a public confession of their faith bya partici-
pation os the Lord’s supper. 'l'hc regulatiou of Zepheriuus
was good in itself, but was grossly perverted by his successore,
when they made acertain law that there should be one com·
muniou in a year; the consequence of which has been, that
almost all men, when they have communicated once, resign
themselves to lethargic repose, as if they had fairly excused
themselves for all the rest of the year. A very different prac-
tice ought to have been pursned. At least once in every week
the table of the Lord ought to have been spread before each
congregation of Christiane, and the promises to have been de·
clared for their spiritual nourishment; no person ought to have
been compelled to partake, but all ought to have been exhorted
and stimulated, and those who were negligent, to have been
reproved. 'l'hen all, like persons famisbed, would have assem-
bled in crowds to such a banquet. l have sufficient reason for
complaining that it was the artifice of the devil that introduced
this custom, which, by prescribing one day iu a year, renders
men slothful and careless all the rest of the time. We see that
this abuse hod already beguu to prevail in the time of Chry· '
sostom, but we see at the same time how greatly it displeased
him.= For in the place which l have just quoted, he severely
complains of a great inequality in this matter, that oftentimes
people would not come to the sacrament all the rest of the
year, notwithstanding they were prepared, but that they would
come at Easter even without preparation. Theo he exclai'ms,
“O custom! Opresumption! ln vain, then, is tho daily obla·
tion; in vain do we stand at the altar. There is no one to
partake with us.’' So far is such a practice from being sanc·
tioned by the authority of Obrysostom.

XLVII. From the same source proceeded another regulation,
which has robbed or deprived the principal part of the people
of God of one half of the sacred supper, l me'an the symbol
of the blood, which has been interdicted to the laity and the pro·
fane, -for by these titles they distinguish the Lord's beringe,-

and has become the peculiar privilege of the few who Ἢ
