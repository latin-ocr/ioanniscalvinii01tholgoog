Philip were of an age capable of exercising repentance and
faith. We streuuously deny that such persons ought to be
baptized, without a knowledge of their repentance and faith, as
far, at least, as they· are capable of being ascertaincd by the
judgment of men.. But that infanta ought to be ranked in a
different class, is sufficiently evident3 for, under the former
dispensatim, if any person connected himself with the Israel·
ites in religious communion, it was necessary for him to be
taught the covenant of the Lord, and instructed in the law,
before he received circumcision, because he was an alien by
birth, not one of the Israelitish people, with whom the cove-
nant, which was confirmed by circumcisionum been made.

XXIV. So the Lord himself, when be adopts Abraham,
does not begin with circumcision, concealing for a time what
was intended by that sign3 but he first announces tho cove-
nant which he designs to make with him, and then, after he
bas received that promise in faitb, makes him a partaker of that
sacrament. Why does the sacrament follow faith in the case
of Abraham, and in Isaac, his son, precede all exercise ot‘ under·
standing? Because it isreasonable that a person, who at an
adult age is admitted to the fellowship of a covenant, to which
he had hitherto been a stranger, should first learn the conditione
ot‘ it 3 but this is not necessary in the case of an infant, who, by
hereditary right, according to the form of the promise, is already
included in the covenant from its very birth. Or, to express it
with greater claarness and brevity, if the children of believers,
without the aid of understanding, are partakers of the covenant,
there is no reason why they should be excluded frorn the sign
&cause they are not capable of expressing their consent to the
stipulation of the covenant. This is evidently the reason why
God sometimes declares the children descended from the lsrael-
ites to be born to himself ;(q) for he undoubtedly considers
as his children, the children of those to whose seed he has
promised to bea Father. But he who is an unbeliever, de·
scended from impious parents, is accounted an alien from the
communion of the covenant, till he be united to God by faith.
Itis no wonder, therefore, if he be not a partaker of the sign,
the signification of which in him would be delusive and vain.
In this sense Paul tells the Ephesians, that as long as they
were immersed in idolatry, they were “strangers from the
covenant.'' (r) The whole of the subject, if I mistake not,
may be clearly and summarily stated in the following position 3
that persons of adult age, who embracc the Christian religion,
having been hitherto aliens from the covenant, are not to
receive tbe signos baptism without the intervention of faith
