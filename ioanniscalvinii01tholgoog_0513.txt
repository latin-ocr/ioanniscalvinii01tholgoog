gave them circumcision, which was a sign to teaeh the Jews that
he would be their defence and salvation3 and the knowledge of
this inspired their hearts with the hope os eternal life. For what
can ba wanting to them whom God has taken into his charge?
Wherefore the apostle, with a view to prove that the Gentiles
are children of Abraham as wellas the Jews, expresses himself
in the following manner: “ Paith was reckoned to Abraham
sor righteousness in uncireumcision. And he received the
sign of circumcision, a seal of the righteousness of the saith
which he had yet being uneireumcised; that he might be the
father os all them that believe, though they be not circumcised5
that righteousness might be imputed unto thern also 3 and the
father os circumcision to them who are not os the circumcision
only, but who also walk in the steps os that saith of our father
Abraham, which he had being yet uncircumcised.'’ (i) Do
not we see that equal dignityis attributed to Jews and Gen·
tiles? For during the time fixed by the decree of God, Abra·
barn was the father of circumcision, When the “middle wall
of partition between’' them was “broken down,'’(lc) as the
apostle says in another place, to give the Gentiles an entrance
into the kingdom of God, he became also their father, and that
without the signos circumcision3 for instead os circumcision,
they have baptism. The express intimation, that Abraham
was not a father to them who were of the circumcision only,
was introduced by the apostle, to repress the vain confidenee
os some who neglected all concern about piety, and prided
themselves in mere ceremonias. ln the same manner, we may
now reluta the vanity os those who in baptism never carry
their thoughts beyond the water.

XIV. But in objection to this, another passage is adduced
t‘rom the same apostle, in which he states, “ that they which
· are the children os the flesh ’² are not “ the children ofhbraham,”
but that only “the children of the promise are counted sor the
seed.'' (l) For this passage seems to imply, that carnal descent
from Abraham is nothing, though we attribute some import-
anee to it. But it is requisite to pay more particular attention
to the subject which the apostle is here discussing. For in
order to show to the Jews, that the goodness os God was not
confined to the seed os Abraham, and even that carnal desccnt
from him was os no velue in itsels, he alleges, in proof of it,
the cases of Ishmael and Esau; who, notwithstanding they
were the true offsprrng of Abraham according to the flesh,
were rejected as if they had been strangers, and the blessing
remained with Isaac and Jacob. Hence follows what he after-
wards affirms-that salvation depends on the mercy os God,
