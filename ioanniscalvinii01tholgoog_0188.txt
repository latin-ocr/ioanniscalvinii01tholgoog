affirma that men have no ears to hear, or eyes to see, but such

⁶ as he hasformcd3 and that he acts in this, not according to

individual gratitudo, but according to his own election. Of this.
fact Lulte gives us an eminent example, where Jews and Gentiles
in common heard the preaching of Paul and Barnabas. Thongh
they were all instructed on that occasion with the same dis·
course, it is narrated that “ as many as were ordained to eternal
life, believed.'’(e) With what face, then, can we deny the
freeness of calling, in which election reigns alone, even to
the last?

Ill. Here two errors arc to bc avoided. For some suppose
man to be a cooperator with God‚ so that the validity of elec·
tion depende on his consent, thus, according to them, the will
of man is superior to the counsel of God. As though the
Scriptura taught, that we are only given an ability to believe,
and not saith itself. Others, not thus enervating the grace of
the Holy Spirit, yet induced by 1 ltnow not what mode of rea·
soning, suspend election on that which is subsequent to it; aa
though it were doubtful and ineffectual till it is confirmed by
faith. That this is its confirmation to ns is very clear ; that it
is the manifestation of God’s secret counsel before concenled, we
have already seen, but all that we are to understand by this, is
that what was before unknown is verified, andes it were ratified
with a seal. But it is contrary to the truth to essert, that elec·
tion has no efficacy till after we have embraced the gospel‚
aud that this circumstance gives it all its energy. The cer·
tainty of it, indeed, we are to seelt here; for if we attempt to
penetrate to the eternal decree of God‚ we shall be ingulfed in
the profound abyss. But when God has discovered it to us,
we must ascend to loftier heights, that the cause may not be
lost in the effect. For what can be more absurd and inconsis-
tent, when the Scriptura teaches ¹that we are illuminated
according as God has chosen us, than that our eyes should be so
dazzled with the blaze of this light as to refuse to contemplate
election? At the same time Ι admit that, in order to attain an
assurance of our· salvation, we ought to begin with the word,
, and that with it our confidence ought to be satisfied, so as to
call upon God as our Father. For some persons, to obtain
certainty respecting the counsel of God‚ “which is nigh unto
us, in our mouth and in our heart,’'(f ) preposterously wish
to soar above the clouds. Such temerity, therefore, should be
restraiued by the sobriety of saith, that we may be satisfied
with the testimony of God in his external word respecting his
secret grace; only the channel, which conveys to ns sucha
copious stream to satisfy our thirst, must not deprive the foun-
tain-head of the honour which belongs to it.
