recommending the observance of the commandments oi God,
they insist on an exact obedience to their own, with as much
zeal and anxiety as if the whole essence of piety consisted in
them; when avenging the violation os the Divina law with
slight penalties of satisfactione, they punish the smallest trans·
gression of one of their decrees with nothing less thau im·
prisonment, banishment, lire, or sword; when less severe aud
inexorable against the despisers os God, they persecute the
despisers os themselves with implacable hatred even to death ;
and when they instruct all those whom they hold in the chains
of ignorance in such a manner, that they would feel less con·
cern at sesing the subversion of the whole law os God, than
the violation ol' the smallest tittle of the commanda of the
Church? In the first place, bere isa grievous error, that on

inclines to man. Ι

cell these observances useless and foolish, l know this will not
be admitted by the wisdom os the flesh, which is so pleased
with them, as to consider the Ghurch altogether desonued
where they are abolished. But these are the things which
Paul describes as “having a show of wisdorn iu will-worship,
aad humility, and neglecting os the body; not in any honour
to the satisfying os the flesh.'’(c) 'Phia is certainly a most
salutary admonition, which ought never to be sorgotten by us.
Human traditione, he says, deceive undere show of wisdom.

that being contrived by man, the human mind recognizes them
