ill. But some will say, Does he not, without information,
know both our troubles aud our necessities; so that it may ap
pear unnecessary to solicit him with our prayers, as is he were
inattentive or sleeping, till aroused by our voice? But such
reasoners advert not to the Lord’s end in teaching his people to
pray; for he has appointed it not ιο much t'or his own sake as
for ours. It is his pleasure indeed, as is highly reasonable, that
his right be rendered to him, by their consideriug him as the
Author os all that is desired and found useful by men, and by
their acknowledgments os this in their prayers. But the uti·
lity ot' this sacrifice, by which he is worshipped, returns to us.
The greater the confidence, therefore, with which the ancient
saints gloried in the Divina benefits to themselves and others,
withso much the more earnestness were they incited to pray.
The single example of Elijah shall suffice, who, though certain
os God’s design, having already with sufficient authority pro·
mised rain to lring Ahab, yet anxiously prays between his
lmees, and sends his servant seven times to look l'or it ; (b) not
withan intention to discredit the Divine oracle, but under a
conviction os his duty to prevent his saith beooming languid
and torpid, by pouring out his prayers before God. Where-
fore, although, when we are stupid and insensible to our own
miserias, he vigilantly watches and guarda us, aud sometimes
affords us uusolicited succour, yet it highly concerns us as·
siduously to supplicate him, that our heart may be always in·
flamed witha serious and ardent desire of secking, loving, and
worshipping him, while we accustom ourselves in all our ne·
cessities to resort to him as our sheet anchor. Further, that no
desire or wish, which we should be ashamed sothim ιο know,
may enter our minds; when we leam to present our wishes,
and so to pour out our whole heart in his presence. Next,
that we may be prepared to receive his blessings with true
gratitude oi soul, and even with grateful acknowledgments3
being remiuded by our prayiug that they come from his hand.
Moreover, that when we have obtained what we sought, the
persuasion that he has auswered our requests may excite us to
more ardent meditatione on his goodness, and produce a more
joyful weloome oi those things which we acknowledge to be
the smits oi our prayers. Lastly, that use and experieuce itself
may yield our minds a confirmation of his providence in pro·
portion to our imbecility, while we apprehend that he not only
promises never to forsake us, and sreely opens a way os access
sor our addressing him in the very moment of uecessity; but
that his hand is always extended ιο assist his people, whom he
does not seed withmere words, but supporta with present aid.
