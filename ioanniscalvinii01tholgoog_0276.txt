Luke states to have been practised by the faithful at the ordina-
tion of elders. (n) For knowmg themselves to be engaged in a
business of the highest importance, they dared not attempt any
thing but with the greatest reverence and solicitude. and
above all things, they were earnest in prayers and supplications
to God for the spirit of wisdom and discretion.

XIII. The third inquiry we proposed was, by whom minis·
ters are to be chosen. Now, for thIs no certain urle can be
gathered from the appoimment of the apostleS, which was acase
somewhat difi'erent from the common call of other ministers.
For as theirs was an extraordinary office, it was necessary, iu
order to render it conspicuous by some eminent character, that
they who were to sustain it should be called and appointed by the
mouth of the Lord himself. 'Phe apostles, therefore, entered upon
their work, not in consequence of any human election, but em·
powered by the sole command of God and of Christ. Hence,
when they wish to substitute another In the place of Judas,
they refrain from a certain appointment of any one, but nomi-
nate two, that the Lord may declare by lot which of them he
wills to be his successor. (o) In the same sense must be.
understood the declaration of Paul, that he had been created
“ an apostle, not of men, neither by man, bnt by Jesns Christ,
and God the Father.” (p) The first clause, not os men, was
applicable to him in common with all pious miuisters of the
word, forno man can lawfully exercise thIs ministry without
having been called by God. 'I'he other clause was special and
peculiar to himself. When he glories in this, therefore, he
not only claims what belongs to a true and lawful pastor,
but likewise brings forward an evidence of his apostleship.
For whereas there were, among the Galatians, some who, from
an eagemess to dIminish his authority, represented him asa
common disciple deputed by the primary apostles,— in order to
vindicate the dignity of his preaching, against which he knew
these artifices were dIrected, he found it necessary to show
that he was not Inferior to the other apostles in any respect.
Wherefore he affirma, that he had not been elected by the judg-
ment of men, like some ordInary bishop, but by the mouth and
clear revelation of the Lord himself.

XIV. But that the election and appointment of bishops by
men is necessary to constitute a legitimare call to the office, no
sober person will deuy, while there are so many testimonias of
Scriptura to establish it. Nor is it contradicted by that declara·
tion of Paul, that he was “an apostle,not osmen, nor byman,’' (q)
since he is not speaking in that passage of the ordinary election of
ministers, but claiming to himself what was the special privilege

(a) Acts ziam. (c) Acts izi. (p) Gal. i. l. (q) Gal. i. 1.
