of election, yet, being common also to the reprobate, it would of
itself be no solid proof of it. For God effectually reaches his
elect, to bring them to saith, as we have already cited from the
words of Christ: “He which is of God, he,'' aud he alone,
“ hath seen the Father.'' (y) Again: “ Ι have manifested thy
name unto the men which thou gavest me.” (z) For he says
in another place, “No man can come to me, except the Father
draw him.” (a) This passage is judieiously explained by Au·
gustine in the following words: “ lf, according ιο the declaration
of truth, every one that has learned comes, whosoever comes
not, certainly has not learned. lt does not necessarily follow
that he who can come actually comes, unless he has both
willed and done it ; but every one that has learned of tho Fa·
ther, not only cau come, but also actually comes; where there
is an immediate union of the advantage of possibility, the in·
clination of the will, and the consequent action.'’ In another
place he is still clearer : “ Every one that hath heard and learned
of the Fathcr, cometh unto me. ls not this saying, There is
no one that hears and learns of the Father, and comes not unto
me? For if every oue that has heard and learned of the Father

comes, certainly every one that comes not has neither heard nor ,

learned of the Father3 for if he had heard and learned, he would
come. Very remote from carnal observationis this school, in
which men hear and learn of the Father to come to the Son.”
Just after he says, “This grace, which is secretly communica·
ted to the hearts of men, is received by no hard heart; for the
first object of its communication is, that hardness of heart may
be taken away. When the Father is heard within therefore,
he takes away the heart of stone, and gives a heart of flesh.
For thus he forms children of promise and vessels of mercy
whom he has prepared for glory. Why, then, does he not
teach all, that they may come to Christ, but because all whom
he teaches, he teaches in mercy? but whom he teaches not, he
teaches not in judgment3 for he hath mercy on whom he will
have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth' Thosc whom
God has choscn, therefore, he designates as his children, and de·
termines himself to be their Father. By calling, he introduces
them mto his family, and unites them to himself, that they may
be one. By comrecting calling with election, the Scriptura

. evidently suggests that nothing rs requisite to it but the free

mercy of God. For if we inquire whom he calla, and for what
reason, the answer is, those whom he had elected. But when

· we come to election, wc we nothing but mercy on every side.

And so that observation of Paulis very applicable here- “ It is
not of him that willeth, nor of him that runueth, but of God
that showeth mercy ς ” but not as ft is commonly understood -
