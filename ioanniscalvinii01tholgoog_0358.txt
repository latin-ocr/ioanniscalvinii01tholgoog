Wherefore let not the Church be wise of itaelt', nor think any
thing of itself, but let it fix the boundary ol' its wisdom where
Christ has made an end of speaking. In this manner it will
distrnst all the inventions of its own reason; but in those things
in which it is supported by the word of God, it will not waver
with any distrust or hesitation, but will rest upon it with
strong certainty and unshaken constancy. Thus conliding in
the amplitude of the promises it has received, it will have an
excellent support sor its saith, so that it cannot doubt that the
Holy Spirit, the best guida in the right wey, is always present
with it, but, at the same time, it will remember what advantage
the Lord intends should be received from his Spirit. “ The
Spirit,” says he, “ whom 1 will send from the Father, will guide
you into all truth.” But how will this hedone? Christ says,
“ He shall bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever 1
have said unto you.” (y) He announces, therefore, that nothing
more is to be expected from his Spirit, than that he will
enlighten our minda to discover the truth os his doctrine.
Wheresore it is very judiciously observed by Chrysostom, that
“many boast of the Holy spirim but in those who speek from
themselves this is a salse pretence. As Christ testified that he
spake not os himself, because he spalre from the lav aud the

it. For as Christis the accomplishment os the law and the
propheta, so is the Spirit, os the gospel.'’ These are the words
os Chrysostom. Now, it is easy to inser how great is the error
os our adversaries, who boast of the Holy Spirit sor no other
purpose than to recommend, under his name, doctrines strange
and inconsistent with the word os God, whereas itis his deter-
mination to be connected with the word by an indissoluble
bond; and this was declared by Christ when he promised him
to his Church. And sobe is, in point of sect. The sobriety
which the Lord has once prescribed to his Church, he will
have robe perpetuelly observed ς and he has forbidden the
Church to add any thing to his word, or to diminish any thing
fremit. 'I'his is the iuviolable decree of God and of the Holy
Spirit, which our adversaries endeavour to abrogata, when they
pretend dthat the Church is govemed by the Spirit without

Church to add some things to the writings of the apostles, or st
