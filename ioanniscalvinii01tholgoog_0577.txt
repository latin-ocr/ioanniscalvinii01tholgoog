in emit, aud there will remain no doubt respectiug his meau-
ing. He confirms the same with equal perspicuity iu the
following passage: “ Prepare not your jaws, but your heart; it
is for this that the supper is enjoined. Behold, we believe in
Christ when we receive him by saith; in receiving him, we
know what we think; we take a bit of bread, and our· hears
are satisfied. We are fed, therefore, not by what we see, but
by what we believe.'' Here, also, what the wicked partalre
of he restriots to the visible sign, and pronounces that Christ
is only received by faith. So, iu another place, he expressly
remarks that the good and the wicked partake of the elemeuts
in common, and excludes the latter from the true participation
of the body of Christ. For, if they had enjoyed the substance
itself, he would not have been entirely silent on that which
would have strengthened his argument. In another place also,
treating of the eating, and the benefit of it, he concludes thus:
“ Then will the body and blood of Christ be life to every ona, if
that which is visibly received in the sacrament, be, in the truth
which is signified, spiritually eaten and spiritually drunk.’'
Let those, therefore, who, in order to agree with Augustino,
make unbelievers partakers of the flesh and blood of Christ,
exhibit to us the body of Christ in a visible manner, since he
pronounces the whole truth of the sacrament to be spiritual.
And the evident conclusion from his language is, that the sa·
eramental eating is nothing more than eating the visible aud
extemal sign, when unbelief precludes the entrance of the sub-
stance. If the body of Christ could be eaten truly, without
being eaten spiritually, what could be the meaning of Augus-
tine, when he said, “ You are not to eat this body which you
see, and to driuk the blood which will be shed by those who
shall crucify me. I have appointed a sacrament for you;
spiritually understood, it shall vivify you.'' He certainly did
not mean to deny that the same body which Christ offered in
sacrifice is exhibited in the supper; but he designates the mode
of participating in it-that though it has been received into
celestia] glory, it inspires us with life by the secret influence
of the Holy Spirit. lacknowledge that he frequently speaks
of the body of Christ as eaten by unbelievers but he explains
his meaning by adding that it is done sacramentally; and, in
another place, he describes the spiritual eating as not consisting
in a corporeal swallowing of the grace of God. And that my
adversaries may not charge rne with a wish to overwhelm
them by an accumulation of passages, l would request them to
inform 'me how they can evade that one declaration of his,
where he says, “that the sacramenta realize what they repre·
sentin the elect alone.” Surely they will not dare to deny
that the breed represents the body of Christ. Hence it follows,
