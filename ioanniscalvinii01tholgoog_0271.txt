himself, indeed, gives this name to “Andronicus and Junia,
who,’' he says “are of note among the apostles;''(l) but
when he means to speak with strict propriety, he never applies
that namo except to those of the first order that wo have men-
tioned. And thiais the common usage of the Scripture. But
the province of pastore is the same as that of the apostles‚ ex-
cept that they preside over particular Ohurches respectively
committed to each of them. Of the natura of their functione
let us now proeeed to a more distinct statement.

Vl. Our Lord, when he sent forth his apostlcs, commissioned
them, as we have just remarked, to preach the gospel‚ and to
baptiza all believers for the remissiori of sins. (m) He had
already commanded them to distribute the sacred symbols of
his body and blood according to his own example. (n) Behold
the sacred, inviolable, and perpetual law imposed upon those
who call themselves successore of the apostlcs3 it commanda
them to preach the gospel, and to administer tha sacramenta
Hence we conclude, that those who neglect both these duties
have no just pretensions to the character of apostles. But what
shall we say of pastore? Paul speaks not only of himself, bnt of
all who bear that office, when he says, “ Let a man so account
of us, as of the ministers of Christ, aud stewards of the mysteries
of God.” (o) Again: “ A bishop must hold fast the faithful word
as he hath been taught, that he may be able, by sound doctrine,
both to exhort and to convince the gainsayers.'’ (p) From these
aud similar passages, which frequently occur, wc may infer that
the preaehing of the gospel, aud the administration of the sacra·
ments, constitute the two principal parts of the pastoral office.
Now, the business of reaching is not confined to public discourses,
but extends also to private admonitions. Thus Paul calls upon
the Ephesians to witness the truth ofhis declaration, “ 1 have kept
back nothing that was profitable unte you, but have shewed
you, and have taught you publicly‚ and from house to house,
testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance
toward God, and faith toward onr Lord Jesus Christ.” Anda
little after: “ l ceased not to warn every one, night aud day, with

, tears.'' (q) But it isne part of my present design, to enumerate

all the excellences of a good pastor, but only to show what is
implied in the profession of those who call themselves pastors3
namely, that they preside over the Church in that station, not
that they may cnjoy a respectable sinecure, but to instruct the
pcople in true piety by the doctrine of Christ, to administer the
holy mysteries, to maintain and exercise proper discipline. For
the Lord denounces to all those who have been stationed as
