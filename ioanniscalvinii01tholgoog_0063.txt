two men, the one of a life hely and perfect even to a miracle,
the other a man of probity and integrity, yet not so perfect but
that many desecte might be discovered, he at length makes
this inference: “The latter, whose character appears inferior
to the former, on account of the true faith in God by which he
lives, and according to which he accuses himself in all his de-
liuquencies, and in all his good worlrs praises God, ascribing
the glory to him, the ignominy ιο himself, and deriving from
him both the pardou of his sins and the love os virtue; this
man, 1 say, when delivered from this life, removes into the
presence of Christ. Wherefore, but ou account offaith? which,
though no man be saved by it without works, (for it is not a
reprobate faith, but such as works by love,) yet produces re-
missiou of sins, for the just lives by faith ς (ι’) but without it,
works apparently good are perverted into sins.’' Here he
avows, without any obscurity, that for which we so strenuously
contend-that the righteousness os good works depende on
their acceptance by the Divine mercy.

VI. Very similar ιο the foregoing passages is the import
of the following: “ Maka to yourselves friends of the mammon
of unrighteousness3 that, when ye fail, they may receive you
into everlasting habitations.’' (lc) “ Charge them that are rich
in this world, that they be not high-minded, nor trust in uncer-
tain riches, but in the living God, that they do good, that
they be rich in good works3 laying up in store for themselves

riches, which we may enjoy in the happiness of eternal life.
Ι reply, that we shall never arrive at the true meaning of these
passages, unless we advert ιο the design of the Spirit in such
language. If Christ's declaration be true, that “where our
treasrue is, there will our beart be also‚” (m)-as the children
of this world are generally intent on the acquisitiones those
things which conduce ιο the comfort of the present life, so it
ought ιο be the concern of believers, after they have been
taught that this life will ere long vanish like a dreanu to trans·
mit those things which they really wish to enjoy, to that place
where they shall possess a perfect and permanent life. It
bchoves us, therefore, to imitate the conduct os those who
determine to migrate ιο any new situation, where they have
choseu ιο reside during the remainder of their lives; they send
their property before them, without regarding the inconveni-
ence of a temporary absence from it; esteeming their happiness
the greater in proportion to the wealth which they possess in
the place which they intend for their permanent resideuce. li
