any solidity or truth? For they use ceremonias either derived
from Judaism, or invented among themselves, from which it
would be better to refrain. But as to any real examination,
the consent of the people, and other necessary things, they are
not mentioned. The shadow they retain of these things,1
consider not worthy of notice. By shadow, 1 mean those
> ridiculous gesticulatione, used asa dull and foolish imitation of
antiquity. The bishops have their vicars, to inquire before
an ordination, into the learning of the candidates. But in
what manner?¹ 'I'hcy interrogate them, whether they can
read their masses3 whether they know how to decline some
common noun that may occur in reading, or to conjugata a
verb, orto tell the meaning of a word ; for it ia not necessary
for them to know how to give the sense of a verse. and yet
none are rejected from the priesthood, who are deficient even
in these puerile elements, provided they bring some present or
recommendation to favour. ln the same spirit itis, that when
the persons to be ordained present themselves at the altar,
some one inquires three times, in a language not understood,
whether they are worthy of that honour. One (who never saw
them before, but, that no part of the process might be wanting,
acts his part in the farne) answers, They are worthy. What
accusation is there against these venerable fathers, but that by
sporting with such manifest sacrileges they are guilty of un·
blushing mockery of Gnd and men? But because they have
bean longia possession of it, they suppose it is now become
right. For whoever ventures to open his mouth against these
glaring and atrocious enormities, they hurry him away to ex·
acution, as if he had committed a capital crime. Would they
do this if they believed that there was any God?
v1. Now, how much better do they conduct themselves in
the collation of benefices l -a thing formerly connected with
ordination, but now entirely separated from it. 'l'he ways in
which this business is managed, are various. For the bishops
are not the only persons who confer benefices, and in those the
collation of which is ascribed to them, they do not always
possess the full power, but while they retain the name of the
collation for the sake of honour, the presentation belongs to
others. Besides these, there are nominations from the collegas,
resignations either absolute or made for the sake of erchange, ·
commendatory rescripta, preventions, and the like. But they
all conduct themselves in such a manner, that no one can
reproach another for any thing. 1 maintain that scarcely one
benefice in a hundred, in all the Papacy, is at present conferred
without simony, according to the definition which the ancients
gave of that crime. ldo not say that they all purchase with
ready mouey; but show me one in twenty who obtains a
