that we may enjoy a real participation of him. And, in fact,
l see not how any man can attain a solid confidence that he
has redemption and righteousness in the cross of Christ, and
1111 in his death, unless he first has a real communion with
Christ himself ; for those blessings would never be imparted to
us, if Christ did not first make himself ours. 1 say, therefore,
that in the mystery of the supper, under the symbols of bread
and wine, Christ is truly exhibited to us, even his body and
blood, in which he has fulfilled all obedience to procura our
justification. And the design of this exhibitionis, first, that
we may be united into one body with him, and, secondly,
that being made partakers of his substance, we may experience
his power in the communication of all blessings.

Xll. 1 now proceed to the hyperbolical additions which su·
perstition has made to this sacrament. For here Satan has
exerted amazing subtlety to withdraw the minds of men from
heaven, and involve them in a preposterous error, by persuading
them that Christ 11 attached to the clement os bread. In the
first place, we must be careful not to dream of such a presence
of Christ in the sacrament as the ingenuity ο1 the Romanists
has invented; as 11 the body of Christ were exhibited, hya
local presence, to be felt by the hand, bruised by the teeth, and
swallowed by the throat. For this was the form ο1 recantation
which Pope Nicolas directed to Berengarius as a declaration of
his repentance; the language of which is so monstrons, that
the scholiast exclaims, that there is danger, unless the readers
be very prudent and cautious, of their imbibing from it a worse
heresy than that of Berengarius; and Peter Lombard, though
he takes great pains to defend it from the charge of absurdity,
yet rather inclines to a different opinion. For, as we have not
the least doubt that Christ's body is finite, according to the
invariable condition of a human body, andis contained in
heaven, where it was once received, till it shall return to judg-
ment, so we esteem it utterly unlawful to bring it back under
these corruptible elementa, or to imagine it to be present every
where. Nor is there any need of this, in order to our enjoying
the participation of it; since the Lord by his Spirit gives us the
privilege ο1 being united with himself in body, soul, and spirit.
The bond of this union, therefore, is the Spirit of Christ, by
whom we are conjoined, and who is, as it were, the charmel
by which all that Christ himself is and has is conveyed to us.
For, if we behold the sun darting his rays and transmitting his
substance, as it were, in thern, to generate, nourish, and mature
the roots of the earth, why should the irradiationes the Spirit
of Christ be less effectual to convey to us the communication
of his body and blood? Wherefore, the Scripture, when it
speaks of our participation of Christ, attributes all the power of
