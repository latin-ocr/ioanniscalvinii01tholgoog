Νο change has taken place in the Lord, who long ago declared
that nothing was so highly offensive to him, aa to attempt to
worship him with the inventions of rnen. Hence those stri·
king declarations in the prophets, which ought to be contin·
ually sounding in our ears: “I spake not unto your fathers,
nor commanded thern in the day that Ι brought them out os
the land of Egypt, concaming bunut-offerings or sacrifices; but
this thing commanded Ι them, saying, Obey my voice, and Ι
will be your God, and ye shall be my pcople: and wallr ye
in all the ways that Ι have commanded you.’' (p) Again:
“I earnestly protested unto your fathers, saying, Obey my
voice.'’ (q) There are many other similar passages, but the
most remarkable os allis the following: “Hath the Lord,”
says Samuel, “ as great delight in burnt-offcrings and sacrifices,
as in obeying the voice of the Lord? Behold, to obey is bet·
tarthan sacrifica, and to hearken than tha fat os rams. For
rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornnass is as
iniqnity and idolatry.'’ (r) Therefore, whatever human invan-
tions relating to the worship of God, may be defended by the
authority os tha Ghurch, since it is impossible to vindicate
thern from impiety, it is easy to infer that the imputation of
them to the Ghurch has no foundation in truth.

XVIII. For this reason wa freely censure that tyranny of
human traditions, which is imposed upon the world under the
name of the Ohurch. Nor do we hold tha Ghurch in contempt,
as our adversaries, in order to render us obnoxious, falsely as·
sert. We allow it the praise of obedience, than which no
higher praise can be given. On the contrary, they are them·
salves the most outrageous violators of the Ghurch, which they
representas guilty of rebellion against the Lord, when they
pretend that it has gone beyond what was permitted by the
word of God, to say nothing of the combinatiou of impudancc
and wickedness discovered in their incessant vociferations re-
specting the authority ot the Ghurch‚ while they take no notice
of the command ot the Lord, or of the obedience dua from the
Ghurch to that command. But if we desire, as we ought, to
agree with the Ghurch, it will be best for us to observa and
remember what commands are given by the Lord, equally to
us and to the whole Ohurch, that we may all obey him with
oua consent. For there iano doubt that we shall fully agree
with the Ghurch, it we show ourselves in all things obedient
to the Lord. Now, to attribute to the apostles the origin os the
traditions which have hitherto oppressed the Ohurch, is a mere
imposture3 for the whole tendency af the doctrine of the
apostles was, that man's consciences should not be burdened
