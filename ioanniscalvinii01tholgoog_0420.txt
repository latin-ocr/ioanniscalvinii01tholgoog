of the Chureh, which eon-eets sins aeoording to the word os
the Lord, is s most excellent preservative os health, foundation
of order, and boud os unity. Therefore when the Ohurch
excludes from its society all who are known to be guilty
os adultery, fornicationi, thest, robbery, sedition, perjnry, salse
witness, md other similar crimes, together with obstinate pen
sons, who, after having been admonished even of smaller fanus,
conten-in God and his judgtnent, —it usurps no unreasonable
authority, but only exsrcises the jurisdiction which God has
given ir. And that no one may despise this judgment os the
Chureh, or consider it as os little importante that he is oon-
demned by the voice os the faithful, God has testified that it is
no other than a declaration of his sentence, and that what they
do on earth shall be ratified in heaven. For they have the
word os the Lord, ro condemn the perverse; they have the
word7 to receive the penitent into favour, Persons who believe
that the Chumh could not subsist without this hond οἰ disci-
pline, are mistaken in their opinion, unless we could sasely
dispenso with that remedy which the honi soresaw would be
necessary sor us; and how very necessary it is, will be better
discovered from its various use*

V. Now, there are three ends proposed by the Chureh in
those corrections, and iu exoornmunieation. The first is, thst
those who lead seandalous and flagitious lives, may not, to
the dishonour os God,< be numbered among Christians; as is
his holy Ghurch were ι conspiracy os wicked and abandoned
men. For as the Chumh is the body os Christ, it cannot be
contaminated with such foul and putrid members without
some ignominy being reflected upon the Hesd. That nothing
may exist in the Chureh, therefore, from which any disgmoe
may be thrown upon his venerabis name, it is necessary to
expel from his family all those from whose turpitude infamy
would redonnd to the profession os Christianity. Here it is
also necessary to have particular regard to the Lord’s supper,
that it may not be prosaned by a promiscuum administrativa.
For it is certain thet he who is intrusted with the dispensation
os it, is he kuowingly and intentionally admit an unworthy
person, whom he might justly reject, is as guilty ef sacrilege
as is he were to give the Lord’s body to dogs. Wheresore,
Chrysostom severely inveighs against priests, whoy from a sear
os the great and the powerful, did not dare to reject any per-
son: who presented themselves. ¹‘ Blood,” says he, ¹¹ shall be
