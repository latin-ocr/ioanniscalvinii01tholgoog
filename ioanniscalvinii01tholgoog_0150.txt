mention of predestination to be as it were buried; they teach
meu to avoid every question concerning it as they would a
precipice. Though their moderatiou is to be commended, in
judgiug that mysteries ought to be handled with such great
sobriety, yet, as they descend too low, they have little influente
on the mind of man, which refuses to submit to uureasonable
restraints. 'Po observe, therefore, the legitimate boundary on
this side also, we must recur to the word os the Lord‚ which
affords a certain rule for the understanding. For the Scriptura
is the school of the Holy Spirit, in which, es nothing necessary
and useful to be known is omitted, so nothing is taught which
it is not beneficial to know. Whatever, therefore, is declared
in the Scripture concerning predestination, we must be cautious
not to withhold from believers, lest we appear either to de·
fraud them of the favor of their God, or to reprove and censure
the Holy Spirit for publishing what it would be useful by arry
means to suppress. Let us, 1 say, permit the Christian man to
open his heart and bis ears to all the discourses addressed to
him by God, only with this moderatiori, that as soon as the
Lord eloses his sacred mouth, he shall also desist from further
inquiry. This will be the best barrier of sobriety, if iu leam·
ing we not only follow the leadings of God, butas soon as he
ceases to teach, we give up our desire of learning. Nor is the
danger they dread, sufficient to divert our attention from the
eracles of God. It is a celebrated observation of Solomon, that
“itis the glory of God to conceal a thing.”(i) But, as both
piety and common sense suggest that this is not to be under·
stood generally ol' every thing, we must seek for the proper
distinction, lest we content ourselves with brutish ignoranco
under the pretext of modesty and sobriety. Now, this distinc-
tion is clearly expressed in a few words by Moses. “ 'Pha
secret things,'’ he says, “belong unto the Lord our God3 but
those things which are revealed belong unto us, and to our
children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.’'(lc)
For we see how he enforces on tbe people attention to the
doctrine of the law only by the celestial decree, because it
plsased God to promulgate it; arrd resti-ains the same people
within those limits with this single reason, that it is not lawful
for mortals to intrude into the secrets of God.

IV. Profane persons,l confess, suddenly lay hold of some·
thing relating to the subject of predestination, to fumish occa·
sion for objections, cavils, reproaches, and ridicule. But if we
are frighteued from it by their impudance, all the princi·
pal articles of the faith must be concealed, for there is scarcely
one of them which such persons as these leave inviolated by
