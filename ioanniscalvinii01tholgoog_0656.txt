XIII. In the last place, 1 think it necessary to add, that
tributes and taxes are the legitImate revenues of princes;
which, iudeed, they ought priucipally to employ iu sustaining
the public expensas of their office, but which they may like·
wise use for the support of their domestic splendour, which is
closely connected with the dignity of the government that
they hold. Thus we see that David, Jehoshaphat, Hezelriah,
Josiah, and other pious kings, and likewise Josaph and Daniel,
without any violation of piety, on account of the office which
they filled, lived at the public expense ; and we read in Ezekiel
of a very ample portion of land being assigned to the kings ; (c)
in which passage, though the prophet is describing the spiritual
kingdom of Christ, yet he borrows the model of it from the
legitimate lrIngdoms of men. On the other hand, priuces
themselves ought to remember, that their finances are not so
much private incomes‚ as the ravenues of the whole people,
according to the testimony of Paul, (y) and therefore cannot
be lavished or dilapidated without manifest injustice; or, rather,
that they are to be considered as the blood of the people, not to
spare which is the most inhuman cruelty; and their various
imposts and tributas ought to be regarded merely as aids of the
public necessity, to burden the people with which, without
cause, would be tyrannical capacity. These things give no
encouragement to princes to indulge profusion and luxury; and
certainly there is no need to add fuel to their passions, which
of themselves are more than sufficiently inflamed; but, as it is
of very great importance, that whatever they undertake they
attempt it with a pure conscience before God, it is necessary,
in order to their avoiding vain confidence and contempt of
God, that they be taught how sar their rights extend. Noris
this doctnne useless to private persons, who leam from it not to
pronounce tash and insolent censuras on the expensos of princes,
notwithstanding they exceed the limirs of common life.

XIV. From the magistracy, we next proceed to the lawa,
which are the strong nerves of civil polity‚ or, according to an
appellation which Cicero has borrowed from Plato, the seuleus
states, without which magistracy cannot subsist, as, on the
other hand, without magistrates laws are of no force. No ob·
servation, therefore, cau be more correct than this, that the law
is asilent magistrate, and a magistrate aspeaking law. Though
1 have promised to show by what laws a Christian state ought
to be regulated, it will not be reasonable for any person to
expecta long discussion respecting the best lrind of laws3
which isa subject of immense extent, and foreign from our
present object. [will brielly remark, however, by the way,
