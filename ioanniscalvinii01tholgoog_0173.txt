who tells us, that God will be clear when he isjudged by
mortal man. (a)

111. Thus God is able to check his enemies by silence.
But that we may not suffer them to deride his holy name with
impunity, he supplies us from his word with arms against
· thern. Theresore, is any one attack us with such an inquiry
as this, why God has from the beginning predestinated some
men to death, who, not yet being brought into existence, could
not yet deserve the sentence os death, -we will reply by ask-
ing them, in return, what they suppose God owes to man, is he
chooses to jndge os him from his own nature. As we are all
corrupted by sin, we must necessarily be odiens to God, and
that not from tyrannical cruelty, bnt in the most equitable
estimation os justice. If all whom the Lord predestinates to
death are in their natural condition liable to the sentence of death,
what injustice do they complain of receiving from him? Let
all the sons of Adam come forward3 let thern all contenti and
dispnte with their Creator, because by his eternal providente
they were previously to their birth adjudged to endless misery.
What murmur will they be able to raise against this vindication,
when God, on the other hand, shall call them to areview of
themselves. If they have all been taken from a corrupt mass,
it is no wonder that they are subject to condemnation. Let
them not, therefore, accuse God of injustice, ifhis eternal
decree has destined them to death, to which they feel them·
selves, whatever be their desire or aversion, spontancously led
forwerd by their own nature. Hence appears the perverseness
os their disposition to murmur, because they intentionally sup
press the cause es condemnation, which they are constrained
to acknowledge in themselves, hoping to excuse themselves by
charging it upon God. But though 1 ever so osten admit
God to be the author os it, which is perfectly correct, yet this
does not abolish the guilt impressed upon their consciences,
and l'rom time to time recurring to their view.

IV. They further object, Were they not, by the decrce of
God, antecedently predestinated to that corruption which is
now stated aa the cause of condemnation? When they perish
in their corruption, therefore, they only suffer the punishment
ol that misery into which, in consequence of his predesti-
nation, Adam fell, and precipitated his posterity with him. Is
he not unjust, therefore, in treating his creatures with such
cruel mockery? 1 confess, indeed, that all the descendants of
Adam sell by the Divine will into that miserable condition in
which they are now involved ; and this iswhat lasserted from
the beginning, that we must always return at last to the sove-
