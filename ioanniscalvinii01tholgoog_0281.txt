devil,and one said,lam of Paul‚and another, lam of Cephas,
⁴ the Ohurches were governed by a common council of presbyters.
Afterwards, in order tu destroy the seeds of dissensione, the whole
charge was committed to one. Therefore, as the presbyters
know that according to the custom of the Church they are
subject to the bishop who presides over them, so let the
bishops know that their superiority to the presbytera is more from
custom than from the appointment of the lord, and they ought
to unite together iu the government of the Ohurch.’' ln another
place, he shows the antiquity of this institution; for he says,
that at Alexandria, even from Mark the Evangelist to Heraclas
and Dionysius, the presbytera always chose oue of their body
to preside over them, whom they called their bishop. Every
city, therefore, had its college of presbyters, who were pastore
and toachers. For they all executed the duties of teaching‚
exhorting, and correcting‚ among the people, as Paul enjoins
bishops to do ς (e) and in order to leave successore behind them,
they laboured in training young men, who had enlistod thern-
selves in the sacred warfare. 'I'o every city was assigned a cer·
tain district, which received presbyters from it, and was reckoned
as a part of that Ohurch. Every assembly, as 1 have stated, for
the sole purpose of preserving order and peace, was under the di·
rection of one bishop, who, while he had the precedence of all
others in dignity, was himself subject to the assembly of the
brethren. If the territory placed under his episcopata was too
extensive to admit of his discharging all the duties of a bishop
iu every part of it, presbyters were appointed in certain statione,
to act as his deputies in things of minor importance. These
were called chorepiscopi, or country bishops, because in the
country they represented thc bishop.

111. But with respect to the office of which we are now
treating, the bishops and presbyters were equally required to
employ themselves in the dispensation of the word and sacra·
ments. For at Alexandria only, because Arius had disturbed
the Ohurch there, it was ordained that no presbyter should
preach to the people; aeis asserted by Socrates in the nlnth
boolr of his Tripartite History, with which Jerome hesitates
not to'express his dissatisfaction. It would certainly have
been regarded as a prodigy, if any man had claimed the cha·
ractcr of a bishop, who had not shown himself really such in
his conduct. Such was the strictness of those times, that all
⁴ ministers were constraiued to discharge the duties which the
Lord requires of thern. l refer not to the custom of one age
only, for even in the time of Gregory, when the Ohurclr was
almost extinct, or at least had considerably degenerated from
its ancient purity, it would not heve been permitted for any
