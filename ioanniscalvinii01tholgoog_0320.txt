XVII. But when our adversaries wrsh to make this a reason
l'or ascribing to that Church the primacy and sovereign power
over other Churches, they 11111,οε I have already observed,
into a gross error. 'Po make this the more evident, 1 will first
briefly show what the ancient writers thought respecting this
unity‚ 011 which our opponents so urgently insist. Jerome,
writing to Nepotian, after having enumerated many exemplos
01 unity‚ at length descende to the hierarchy 01 the Church.
'‘ EveryChurch‚’' he says, “ has its distinct bishop, archpresby-
ter, and archdeaoon, and all the orderos the Church depends upon
its governors.” This is the language 01 a Roman priest, re·
commending unity in the order 01 the Church. Why does he
not mention that all Churches are connected together under one
head, as by a common bond? Nothing would have been
more in favour 01 his argument ; nor can it be pretended that
he omitted it for want 01 recollection; he would most rcadily
have mentioned it, 11 the fact had permitted him. Itis ba-
yond all doubt, therefore, that he saw this to be the true kind
01 unity‚ which is most excellently described by Cyprian in
the following passage: “ There is only one bishopric, 01 which
. every bishop holds an integral part3 and there is but 000
Choreb, which is widely extended into a multitude by the off·
spring of its fertility. As the sun has many rays, bnt only one
light; as a tree has many branchos, but only ona trunlr, fixed
on a firm root; and as many rivers issue from one spring, and
notwithstanding the number 01 1110 streams in which its over·
flowing abundance is diffused, yet the unity 01 the source
remains the same5-so also the Church, illuminated with the
light 01 1110 Lord, extends its rays over the whole earth, yet it
isone and the same light which is universally diffused, nor is
the unity 01 the body destroyed. It stretches its branchos, it
pours out its ample streams, all over the world; yet therela
but one root, and one source.'' Again: “ 'Phe sponsa 01 Christ
cannot be corrupted3 she aclrnowledges one Master, and pre·
serves her fidelity to him inviolate.'’ We see how he attri-
butes the universal bishopric, which comprehendo the whole
Church, to Christ alone, and says that integral portions 01 it
010 confided to all those who discharge the episcopal office
under this head. Where is the primacy 01 the see 01 Romo,
11 the universal bishopric be vested in Christ alone, and every
bisbop hold an integral portion 01 it? My object, in these
quotations, has been, to convince the reader, by tha way, that
this principle, which the Romanists assume as an admitted and
indubitable maxim, namely, that the unity os the Church 10-
quires the supremacy 01 00100 earthly head, was altogether
unknown to the ancienta
