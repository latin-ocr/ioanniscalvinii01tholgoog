lamb was to be sacrificed in its first year3 whence it should
follow, that it is not at all necessary to wait for many years, but
that our children ought to be dedicated to God iu their earliest
infancy. 18. He further contends, that none can come to Christ
but those who have been prepared by John; as though the of-
fice of John had not been a temporary one. But to pass over
this ; the children whom Christ took up in his arms and blessed,
had certainly no such preparation. Wherefore let him depart
with his false principle. 19. At length he calls in the assist-
anae of Trismegistus and the Sibyls, to show that sacred
ablutious are not suitable to any but adults. See what honour·
able sentimenta he entertains respecting the baptism of Christ,
which he would conform to the profane rites of the beathen,
that its administration might be regulated by the pleasure of
Trismegistus. But we have more reverence for the authority
of God, who hasbeen pleased to consecrate infants to himself,
and to initiate them by a sacred sign, the meaning of which
they were too young to be able to understand. Nor do we
esteem it lawful to borrow from the ablutions of the heathen

any thing that may introduce into our baptism the least change ’

of that eternal and inviolable law which God has established
respecting circumcision. 20. ln the last place, he argues, that
if it be lawful to baptize infants without understanding, baptism
may be, in mimicry and jest‚ administered by boys in play.
But he must contest this subject with God, by whose command
circumcision was performed upon infante, before they had at·
tained any understanding. Was it a ludicrous ceremony, then,
or a fit subject for the sports of children, that they could over
turn the sacred institution of God? But it is no wonder that
these reprobate spirits, as if transported with frenzy, bring
forward the most enormous absurdities iu defence of their
errors; for such delusion is the just judgment of God upon
their pride and obstinacy. And l trust 1 have clearly shown
the futility of all the arguments with which Servatus has en·
deavoured to assist the cause of his Anabaptist brethren.
XXXII. No doubt, l conceive, can now remain iu the mind
of any sober man, that those who raise controversias arrd con-
tentione on the subject of infant baptism are presumptuous dis-
turbers of the Church of Christ. But itis worth while to no
tice the object which Satan aims at promoting by so much
subtlety3 which is, to deprive usos the peculiar benefit of
confidence aud spiritual joy, which is to be derived from this
source, and in the same degree also to diminish the glory of
the Divine goodnesa For how delightful isit to pious minda,
not only to have verbal assurances, but even ocular proot', of
their standing so high in the favour of their heavenly Father,
that their posterity are also the objecta of hiscere! For here
