nourishes, refreshes, strengthens, and exhilaratas. For if we
duly consider the benefits resulting to us from the oblation of
his sacred body, aud the effusion of his blood, we shall clearly
perceive that these properties of bread and wine, according to
this analogy, are most justly attributed to those symbols, as
administered to us in the Lord's supper.

1v. 'l'he principa] object of the sacrament, therefore, is not
to present us the body of Christ, simply, and without any ul·
terior consideration, but rather to seal and confirm that promise,
where he declares that his “flesh is meat indeed, and” his
“blood drink indeed‚’' by which we are nourished to eternnl
life ; where he affirma that he is “ the breed of life‚” and that
“ he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever ; ” (e) to seal
and confirm that promise, l say, aud, in order to do this, it
sends us to the cross of Christ, where the promise bas been
fully verified, and entirely accomplished. For we never
rightly and advantageously feed on Christ, except as crucified,
and when we have a lively apprehension of the efficacy of his
death. And, indeed, when Christ called himself “ the breed
of life,” he did not use that appellatiou on account of the sacra·
ment, as some persons erroneously imagine, but because he
had been given to us as such by the Father, and showed him-
self to be such, when, becoming a partaker of our human mor·
tality, he made us partakers of his Divina immortality3 when,
offering himself a sacrifice, he sustained our curse, to fill us
with his blessing; when, by his death, he destroyed and
swallowed up death; when, in his resurrection, this corrupti·
ble flesh of ours, which he had assumed, was raised up by him,
in astate of incorruption and glory.

V. lt remains for all this to be applied to us, which is
done in the first place by the gospel, but in a moro illustrious
manner by the sacred supper, in which Christ offers himself to
us with all his benefits, and we receive him by faith. The
sacrament, therefore, does not first constitute Christ the bread
of life ; but, by recalling to our remembrance that he has been
made the bread of life, upon which we may constantly feed,
and by giving us a taste and relish for that breed, it causes usto
experieuce the support which it is adapted to afford. For it
assures us, in the first place, that whatever Christ has donc or
suffered, was for the purpose of giving life to us, and, in the
next place, that this life will never end. For as Christ would
never have been the bread of life to us, if he had uot beenborn,
and died, and risen again for us, so now he would by no means
continue so, if the efficacy and benefit of his nativity, death, and
resurrection, were not permanent and immortal. All this Christ

bas beautifully expressed in these words: ‘¹ The breed that Ι
