with the spoils of the Ohurch, who say to you, Well done, well
done! The life os the poor is sown in the streets of the rich3
silver glitters in the mire 3 people run to it from all parts3 it is
borne away, not by tlre poorest, but by the strongest, or perhaps
by him who runs fastest. 'ruis custom, or rather this mortal
corruption, commenced not with you ; Ι wish it may ond with
you. Iu these circumstances you, a postor, are proceeding‚
covered with abundant and costly attire. If Ι might dare to
use the expression, these are rather the pestors of devils than
os sheep. Did Peter act in this manner? Was Paul guilty οἱ
such triding? Your court has been accustomed to receive
men good, more than to malre them so. For the wicked are
not improved in it, but the good are cormpted.” 'I'he abuses
of appeals which he relatos, no picus person can read without
the greatest horror. At length, respecting the insatiable cu·
pidity ol' the see oi Rome inthe usurpationes jurisdiction, he
concludes in the following manner: “l spealr the murmur and
common complaint of the Churches. They exclaim that they
- are divided and dismembered. There ure few or none of them
who do not either bewail or dread this plague. Do you inquire
what plague? Abbots are torn away from their bishops, bishops
from their archbishops. It is wonderful il this can be excused.
By such conduct you prove that you have a plenitude oi
power, but not os justice. Yon act thus because you can, but
the question is whether you ought. You are appointed to
preserve to all their respective honour and ranlt, and not
to envy them.’' 'I'hese few passages I have thought proper to
recito, out osa great many, partly that the readers moysee how
sedly the Ohttrch had then declined, and partly that they may
know into what sorrow and lamentatiou all good men wera
plunged by this calamity.

XIX. But though we should grant to the Roman poutiff in
the present day the sanie eminence and extent oi jurisdiction
which this see possessed in the middle ages, as in the times ot
Leo and Gregory‚ what is that to the Papacy ln its present
statcl Ι am not yet referring to the temporal aud secular
power, which we shall afterwards examine iu its proper place;
but the spiritual govemment itself of which they boant, what
resemblance hesit to the condition of those times? For the
Romanists designate the pope uo otherwise thau as the supreme
head of the Ohurch on earth, and universal bishop of the whole
world. And the poutiffs themselves, when they spealr of their
authority, pronounce with great superciliousness, that they
have the power to command, aud that to others is only lest the
necessity to obey; that all their decrees are to be received aa
il they were confirmed by tho voice os St. Peter3 that sor
wantos their presence, provincial synoda have no authority3
