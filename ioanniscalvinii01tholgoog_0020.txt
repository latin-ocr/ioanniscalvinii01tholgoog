whom the Father is reconciled to us3 and the efficacy of
whose death is perpetually the same, consisting in ablution,
satisfaction, expiation, and perfect obedieuce, which covers all
our iniquities. And Paul does not tell the Ephesians that they
are indebted to grace merely for the beginning of their salva·
tion, but that they “are saved by grace, not of worlrs, lest any
tuan should boast.’‘ (o)

XII. The subterfuges, by which the schoolmen endeavour
to evade these arguments, are unavailing. They say, that the
sufficiency of good works to justification ariscs not from their
intrinsic merit, but from the grace through which they are
accepted. Secondly, because they are constrained to acknow·
ledge the righteousness of works to be always imperfect in the
present state, they admit, that as long as we live we need the
remissiones our sins, in order to supply the defects of our

, worlrs; but that ourdeficiencies are compensated by works of

supererogation. lreply, that what they denominate the grace

,through which our works are accepted, isno other than the
free goodness of the Father, witlr which he embraces us in
Christ, when he iuvests us with the righteousness of Christ,
and accepts it as ours, in order that, in consequence of it, he
may treat us as holy, pure, and righteous persons. For tha
rightcousness of Christ (which, being the only perfect right·
eousness, is the only one that can bear the Divina scrutiny)
must be produced on our bchalf, and jndicially presented, as in
the case of a surety. Being furnished with this, we obtain by
faith the perpetual remissiori of our sins. Our imperfectioris
and impurities, being concealed by its purity, are not imputed
to us, but areas it were buried, aud prevented from appearing
in the view of Divina justice, till the advent of that hour,
when the old man being slain and utterly annihilated in us, the
Diviue goodness shall receive us into a blessed peace with the
new Adam, in that state to wait for the day of the Lord, when
we shall receive incorruptible bodies, and be translated to the
glories of the celestial kingdom.

Xlll. If these things are tme‚ surely no works of ours can
render us acceptable to G0d; nor can the actions themselves
be pleasing to him, any otherwise than as a man, who is
covered with the righteousness of Christ, pleases God and
obtains the remissiori of his sins. For God has not promised
eternal life as a reward of certain worlrs; he only declares,
that “he that doeth these things shall live,’'(p) denouncing,
on the contrary, that memorable curse against all who continue
not in the observance of every one of his commands. (q) This
abundantly refutes the erronenus notion of a partial righteous·
