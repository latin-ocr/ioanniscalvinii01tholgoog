supper is a monument, or memorial, appointed to teach us
that the expiatory victim by which God was to be appeased
ought to be offered but once.¹ Nor is it sufficient to know that
Christ is the sole victim, unless we also know that there is only
one oblation‚ so that our saith may be fixed upon his cross.

Vll. Icome now to the concluding observation; that the
sacred supper, in which our Lord had leit us the memorial os
his passion impressed and engraven, has, by the erection os the
mass, been removed, abolished, and destroyed. For the sup·
per itself is a gift ο1 God‚ which ought to be received with
thanitsgiving. The sacrifice os the massis pretended to bea
price given to God‚ and received by him as a satisfaction. As
far as giving differs from receiving, so sar does the sacrifice of
the mass differ from the sacrament os the supper. nno this is
the most miserable ingratitude os inan, that where the prosu·
sion ο1 the Divine goodness ought to have been aclrnowledged
with'thanlrsgivings, there he makes God his debtor. The
sacrament promised, that by the death os Christ we are not
only restored to life, but are perpetually vivified‚ because every
part ο1 our salvation was then accomplished. The sacrifice of
the mass proclaims a very different doctrine; that it is neces-
sary sor Christ to be sacrificed every day, in order to be of any
advantage to us. The supper ought to be distributed in the
public congregation ο1 the Church, to instructus in the com-
munion by which we are all connected together in Christ
Jesus. The sacrifice of the mass dissolves and destroys this
communion. For the reception ο1 this error rendered 11 ne·
cessary that there should be priests to sacrifice lor the people3
and the supper, as 11 11 had been resigned to them, ceased to
be administered to the Church ot' believers, according to the
commandmeut of the Lord. A way was opened sor the admis-
siou os private masses, which represented a kind of excom-
munication, rather than that communion which had been iu-
stituted by our Lord, when the mass-priest separares himself
from the whole congregation of believers, to devour his sacri-
fice alone. That no person may be deceived,l call it aprivate
mass, wherever there is no participation ο1 the Lord's supper
among believers, whatever number of persons may be present
as spectatore os it.

Vlll. With respect to the word nmss itsels, l have never
been able certainly to determine whence it originated; only l
thinlr it may probably have been derived from the oblations
which used to be made at the sacrament. Hence the ancient
fathers generally use it in the plural number. But to sorbear
all controversy respecting the term, 1 say that private masses
are diametrically repugnant to the institution ο1 Christ, and are
cousequently an impious profanation os the sacred supper. For
