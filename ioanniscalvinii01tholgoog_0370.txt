kind of pastore are heard, and that they are not all entitled to
the same attention? Wherefore there is no reason why they
should overawe us with their titles, to make us partakers of
their blindness, while we see, ou the contrary, that the Lord has
taken peculiar care to deter us from suffering ourselves to be
seduced hythe error of other men, under whatever maslr or
name it may be concealed. For if the answer of Christ be
true, all blind guides, whether they are denominated priests,
prelatas, or pontifis, can do nothing but precipitata their fol-
lowers into the same ruin with themselves. Impressed, there·
fore, by these warniugs, both of precepts and of exampleS, no
names of pastors, bishops, or councils, which are as capable of
being falsely claimed as rightly assumed, ought ever to prevent
us from exarniniug all the spirits by the rule of the DIvine
word, in order to “try whether they are of God.”

XIII. Having proved that the Church has received no power
to frama any new doctrine, let us now spealr of the power
which our opponente attribute to it in the interpretationes the
Scripture. We have not the least objection to admit, that if
a controversy arise respecting any doctrine, there is no better
or more certain remedy than to assemble a council of trus
bishops, in which the controverted doctrine may be discussed.
For such a decision, formed by the common consent of the
pastors of the Churohes, after an invocation of the Spirit of
Christ, will have far greater weight, than if every one of them
separately were to maintain it in preaching to his people, or if
it were the result of a private conference between a few indivi-
duals. Besides, when bishops are collected in one assembly,
they deliberate together with greater advantage ou what they
ought to teach, and the manner in which their instructions
should be conveyed, so as to guard against offence arising from
diversity. In the third place, Paul prescribes this method ofde-
termining respecting doctrines. For while he attributes to every
distinct Church a power “ to judge,’' (b) he shows what ought
to be the order of proceeding in more important cases, namely,
that the Ohurches should undertake the common cognizance of
them. And so tlre dictate of piety itself teaches us, that if any

one disturb the Ghurch with a new doctrine, and the matter be κ

carried so far as to cause danger of a more grievous dissension,
the Ghurches should first assemble, should examine the question
proposed to them, and after a sufficient discussion of it, should
annotinae a decision taken from the Scripturas, which would
put an end to all doubt among the people, aud shut the mouths
of refractory and ambitious persons,so as to cheok their further
presumption. Thus, when Arius arose, the Oouucil of Nice
was assembled, and by its authority defeated the peruicious
