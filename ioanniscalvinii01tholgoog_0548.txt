sign os the same thing which is represented to us by the wine
in the sacred supper; for Paul says, “ They did drink the satne
spiritual drink.” (z) But the same water served also for their
docks and herds. Hence it is easily inferred, that when earthly
elements are applied to a spiritual use, no other change takes
place in them than with regard to mm, to whom they become
seals os the promises. Besides, since the design os God is, as
1 have osten repeated, by suitable vehicles to elevate usto
himself, this object is impiously frustrated by the obstinacy os
those who invite us to Christ indeed, but invisibly concealed
under the form os bread. It is not possible sor the human
mind to overcome the immensity os local distance, and to pene·
trate to Christ in the highest heavens. What nature denied
them, they attempted to correct by a remedy yet more per-
nicious, that while remaining on the earth, they might attain
a proximity to Christ without any need of ascending to heaven.
This is all the necessity which constraiued thern to metamor·
phose the body of Christ. ln the time os Bernard‚ though a
harsh mode os expression had been adopted, still transubstan-
tiation was yet unknown, and in all preceding ages it wasa
common similitude, in the mouths of all, that in this sacra·
ment the body and blood oi Christ were spiritually united
with the breed and wine. They argue respecting the terme,
in their own apprehension‚ with great acuteness, but without
adducing any thing applicable to the present subject. The
rod os Moses, they say, though it took the formos a serpent,
still retained its original name, and was called a rod. (a) So
they think it equally probable, that though the breed be
changed into another substance, yet it may by a catachresis,
without any violation of propriety, be denominated according
to its visible appearance. But what similitude or connection
can they discover between that illustrious miracle and their
fictitious illusion, which no eye on earth witnesses? The
magicians had practised their sorceries, so that the Egyptians
believed them to possess a Divine power to effect changes
in the creatures above the order os nature. Moses confronted
them, and defeating all their enchantments, shewed the invin-
cible power os God to be on his side; because his one rod
swallowed up all the rest. But that being a transmutation
visible to the eye, makes nothing to the present argument, as we
have already observed; and the rod soon after visibly returned to
its original form. Moreover, it is not known whether that was
in reality a temporary transmutation of substance or not. The
allusion to the rods os the magicians deserves also to be ob-
served; sor Moses says, that “ staron’s rod swallowed up their
