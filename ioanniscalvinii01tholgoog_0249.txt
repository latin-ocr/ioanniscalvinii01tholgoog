it be, if we obtained a pardon which would afterwards be of
no use? And that the mercy of the Lord would be vain aud
delusive, if it were only granted for once, all pious persons cen
testify to themselves; for every one of them is all his life·
time conscious os many infirmities, which need the Divino
mercy. And surely it is not without reason, that God particu-
larly promises this grace to the members of his family, and
commende the same message of reconciliation to be daily ad-
dressed to them. As we carry about with us the relies of sin,
therefore, as longas we live, we shall scarcely continue in the
Church for a single moment, unless we are sustaiued by the
constant grace of the Lord in forgiving our sins. But the Lord
has called his people to eternal salvation; they ought, therefore,
to believe that his grace is always ready to pardon their sins.
Wherefore it ought to be held as a certain conclusion, that
from the Diviue liberality, by the intervention of the merit of
Christ, through the sanctification of the spirit, pardon of sins
hasbeen, and is daily, bestowed upon us, who have been ad·
mitted and ingrafted into the body of the Church.

were given to the Church, (m) For, when Christ gave com·
mandment to his apostles, and conferred on them the power
of remitting sins, (n) it was not withan intention that they
should merely absolve from their sins those who were converted
from impiety to the Christian saith, but rather that they should
continually exercise this office among the faithful. This is
taught by Paul, when he says, that the message of reconcilia·
tion was committed to the ministers of the Church, that in the
name of Christ they might daily exhort the people to be recon-
ciled to God. (o) ln the communion of saints, therefore, sins
are continually remitted to us by the ministry of the Church,
when the presbytera or bishops, to whom this office is com-
mitted, confirm picus consciences, by the promises of the
gospel, iu the hope of pardon and remission3 and that as well
publicly as privately, according as necessity requires. For
there are many persons who, on account of their infirmity,
stand in need of separate and private consolation. And Paul
tells us that he “ taught,'' not only publicly, but also “from
house to house, testifying repentauce toward God, and faith
toward our Lord Jesus Christ ; ’' (p) and admonished every
individual separately respecting the doctrine of salvation. Here
are three things, therefore, worthy of our observation. First,
that whatever holiness may distinguish the children of God,
yet such is their condition as long as they inhabit amortal
