have made considerable progress in this meditatim, we may
still ackuowledge the conceptione of our minds ιο be extremely
lov, in comparison with the sublimity of this mystery. So-
briety, therefore, is the more necessary for us on this subject,
lest, forgetful of our slender capacity, we presumptuously soar
to too high an elevation, andare overwhelmed with the blaze
of celestial glory. We perceive, likewise, how we are actua·
ted by an inordinate desire of knowing more than is right,
which gives rise to a variety of questions, both frivolous aud
pernicious. 1 call those frivolous, frorn which no advantage
can possibly be derived. But those of the second class are
worse, involviug persons, who indulge them, in injurious spc-
culations, and therefore 1 call thern pernicious. What is taught
in the Scripturas, we ought ιο receive without any controversy3
that as God, in the various distribution of his gifts ιο the saints
in this world, does not equally enlighten thern all, so in heaven,
where God will crown those gifts, thero will be an inequalityin
the degrees of their glory. The language of Paul is not indis·
criminatelyapplicable to all - “ Ye are our glory and joy at our
Lord's coming ; ” (lt) uor Christ’s address to his apostles - “ Ye
shall sit judgiug the twelve tribes os lsrael.” (i) But Paul, who
knew that according as God enriches the saints with spiritual

’ gifts on earth, so he adorna thern with glory in heaven, doubts

not that there is in reservo for him a peculiar crown in propor-
tion to his labours. And Christ commendato hisapostles the
dignity of tha office with which they were invested, by assur·
ing them that the reward of it was laid up in heaven. (lc)
Thus also Daniel: “They that be wisc, shall ahino as the
brightness of the firmament3 and they that turn many to right-
eousness, as the stars, for ever and ever.” (1) And an atten-
tive consideration of the Scripturas will convince us, that they
not only promise etcrnal lifc generally to believers, but also a
special reward to each individual. Whence that expression of
Paul— ‘¹ The Lord reward him according to his worlrs.’' (m)
It is also confirmed by the promise of Christ that his disciplas
should receive a hundred-sold more in eternal life. (n) lna
word, as Christ begins the glory of his body by a manifold
variety of gifts in this world, and enlarges it by degrees, in the
same manner he will also perfect it in heaven.

xl. As all the picus will receive this with one consent, be·
cause it is sufficiently attested in the word of God, so, on the
other hand, dismissing abstruse questions, which they know
to be obstructions to thern, they will not transgress the limits
prescribed ιο thern. For myself‚ 1 not only refrarn aa an indi·
