“My covenant was with Levi. The law of truth was in his
mouth.'' And just afterwards, “The priest’s lips should keep
knowledge, and they should seek the law at his mouth, for
he is the messenger of the Lord of hosts.’' (n) Therefore, if
a priest would be heard, it was necessary for him to provo
himself the messenger of God, by faithfully communicating
the commende which he had received from his master; and
where attention to the priests is enjoined, it is expressly stated,
that “they shall teeeh the sentence of the law '³ (o) of God.
111. 'Phe power of the prophete is fully and bearrtifully de·
scriberl iu Ezekiel-. “Son of man,” says the Lord, “l have
mede thee a watchruan anto the house of lsrael, therefore
hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from
me.'' (p) When he is commanded to hear from the mouth of
the Lord, is he not prohibited to invent any thing of himself?
And what is it to give warning from the Lord, but, to spealr in
such a manner as to be able to declare with confidence that
the meaeage he· has brought is not his own, but the Lord’sl
The Lord expresses the same thing in other words in the pru-
phecy of Jeremiah: “'l’he prophet that heth a dream, let him
tell adream; and he that heth my word, let him spealr my wore
faithfully.''(q) He clearly delivers a law for thern all; its
import is, that he permits no one to teach more than he has
been commandedr and he afterwards gives the appellation· of
“chad'’ to every thing thet has not proceeded from himself
alone, Not one of the prophets opened· his mouth, therefore,
without having first receivedthe words frorn the Lord. Hence
their frequent use of these expressions: “The word of the
Lord,” “'l'hs burden of the Lord,'’ “'l'hus saith the Lord‘·,”
‘¹ 'Phe mouth of the Lord hath spoken ; ’' aud' this was highly
necessary, for lseiah eaclaimed, “l arn a man of uncleen
lips 3 ’¹ (r) and letemiah said, “ Behold, l cannot speak, for l arn
a childr’f (s) What could prooeed from the pollution of the
one, and the follyof the other, but impure and foolish speeches,
if they had spoken their own words? But their lips were holy
and pure, when they began to be the orgaus of the Holy S irit.
While the prophete were bound by this law to deliver nothing
but what they hed received, they were likewise adorned with
eminent power and splendid titles, For when the Lord de·
clares, “ See,I have this day set thee over the natione, and
over the kingdoms, to root out, and' to pull down, and to de·
stroy, and to throw down, and to bnild, and to plant,'’ he at ,
the same time assigna the resson-“Behold,1have put my
words in thy mouth.” (t)-
