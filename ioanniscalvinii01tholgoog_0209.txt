Christ, the other in the omnipotence of God. Now, whenever
the resurrection is mentioned, let us set before us the image of
Christ, who, in our nature, which he assumed, linished his
course in this mortel life in such a manner, that, having now
obtained immortality, he is the pledge of future resurrection ιο
us. For in the afflictione that befall us, “ we bear about in the
body the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus
might be made manifest iu our body.” (b) And to separate
him from us, is not lawful, nor indeed possible, without rend-
ing him asunder. Hence the reasoning of Paul: “If there be
uo resurrection of the dead, then is Christ not risen3 ” (c) for
he assumes this as an aclmowledged principle, that Christ
neither fell under the power of death, nor triumphed over it in
his resurrection, for himself aa a private individual; but that
all this was a commencemeut in the Head of what must be
fullilled in all the members‚ according ιο every one's order and
degree. For it would not be right, indeed, for them ιο be in
all respecta equal ιο him. It is said in the Psalms,“'1'hou
wilt not suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.” (d) Though
a portion of this confidence belongs to us, according ιο the mea-
sure bestowed upon na, yet the perfect accomplishment has been
seen in Christ alone, who had his body restored to him entire,
free from all corruption. Now that we may have no doubt
of our fellowship with Christ in his blessed resurrection, and
may be satisfied with this pledge, Paul expressly affirma that
the design of his session in heaven, and his advent in the cha·
racter of Judge at the last day, is to “ change our vile body, that
it may be fashioned like unto his glorious body.'’ (e) ln an·
other place also, he shows that God raised his Son from the
dead, not in order to display a single specimen of his power,
but to exert on believers the same energy of his Spirit, whom
he therefore calls ‘⁴ our life '’ while he dwells in us, because
he was given for this very purpose, “ ιο quicken our mortal
bodies.’' (s) Iam but briefly glancing at things which would
admit of a fuller discussion, and are deserving of more elegance
of style; but Ι trust the pious reader will find in a small com-
pass sufficient matter for the edificationes his faith. Christ,
therefore, rose again, that we might be the companions of his
future life. He was raised by the Father, inasmuch as he was
the Head of the church, from which he does not suffer him to
be separated. He was raised by the power of the Spirit, who is
given ιο us also sor the purpose of quickening us. In a word,
he was raised that he might be “ the resurrection and the life.’'
But as we have observed that this mirror exhibite to us a lively
image of our resurrection, so it will fumish a firm foundation
