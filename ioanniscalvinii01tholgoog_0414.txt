facetious wit, ironically professing the same object, were in ψ
reality supporting the opposite side of the question. But this
cause is well worthy of such advocates as the pope hires to
defend it ; and equally worthy are those mercenary scribblers of
being disappointed in their hopes of gain, as was the case with
Eugubiuus.

Xlll. But if any one inquire the time when this ficti·
tious empire began to arise, there have not yet elapsed five
hundred years since the pontiffs were still in subjection to the
emperors, and no pontiff was created without the authority of
the emperor. Tlre first occasion of innovation in this order
was given to Gregory vn. by the emperor Henry, the fourth
of that name, a man of rash and unsteady disposition, of no
judgment, great audacity, and dissolute life. For wheu he had
all the bishoprics of Germany in his court, either exposed to
sale, or to be distributed as a booty, Hildebrand, who had been
offended with him, seized a plausible preterit to avenge himself.
Because he appeared to advocate a good and pious cause, he
was assisted by the favour of many ; and Henry, on the other
hand, had rendered himself odious to the generality of princes,

vigorous and legitimate exertion to repress the cupidity of the
poutiffs Thus we see with what plausibility they have repre-
sented this admirable donation of Constantine, by which the
pope pretends himself to have been invested with the sove-
reignty of the Western empire.

XIV. From that period the pontiffs have never ceased en·
oroaching on the jurisdictions, and seizing on the territorias, of

. others, sometimes employing fraud, sometimes treachery, and
sometimes open war, even the city of Rome itself‚ which till
then was free, about a hundred and thirty years ago was com-
pelled to submit to their dominiou; in short, they proceeded
to malie continual advances, till they attained the power which
they at present possess, and for the retention or augmentation
of which, they have now, sor the space of two hundred years,
(for they had begun before they usurped the government of the
city‚) so disturbed and distracted the Christian world, that they
