We must now treet of the order which it has been the Lord's
will to appoint for the govemment of his Ghurch, For although
hc alone ought to rule and reign in the Church, and to have all
preeminence in it, and this government ought to be exercised
and administered solely by his word-yet, as he dwells not
among us by a visible presence, so as to make an audible de-
claration of his will to us, we have stated, that for this purpose
he uses the ministry of rnen whom he employa as his delegatas,
not to transfer his right and honour to them, but only that he
may himself do his work by their lips; just as an artifioer
makes use of an instrument in the performance of his work.
Some observatione which 1 have rnade already, are necessary to
be repeated here. lt is true that he might do this either by
himself, without any means or instrumenta, or even by angels;
hut there are many reasons why he prefers making use of men.
For, in the first place, by this method he declares his kindness
towards us, since he chooses from among men those who are
to be his ambaesadors to the world, to be the interpretare of
his secret will, and even to act as his personal representatives.
And thus he affords an actual proof, that when he so fre-
quently calls us his temples, it is notan unmeaning appel·
lation, since he gives answers to men, even from the mouths
of men, aa from a sanctuary. In the second place, this is a
most excellent and beneficial method to train us to humility,
since he accustoms us to obey his word, though it is preached
to us by men like ourselves, and sometimes even of inferior
rank. If he were himself to speak frorn heaven, there would
be no wonder if his sacred oraclcs were instantly received
with reverence, by the ears and hearts of all mankind. For
who would not be awed by his present power? who would not
fall prostrate at the first view of infinite Majesty? who would
not be confounded by that overpowering splendour? But
whena contemptible mortal, who had just emerged from the
dust, addresm us in the name of God, we give the best
