forgiven, be baptized. For in baptism tho Lord promises re-
mission of sins3 receive this and be secure.” 1« i: not my
design, however, to diminiah the efficacy of baptism but the
substance and truth aceompaniea the sign, aa God works by
externul means. Nevertheless, from this sacrament, aa froin
all others, wa obtain nothing except what we receive by saith.
lt* tuith bo wanting, it will be a testimony of our ingratitudo,
to render us guilty before God, because we have not believed
the promise given in the sacrament; but as baptism is a sig-n of
our confession, we ought to testify by it, that our coufidcnee
is in the mercy of God, and our purity in the remissiori of sina,
which is obtained for us by Jesua Christ; and that we enter
into the Church of God iu order to live in the sama harmony
of saith and charity, of ono mind with all the faithful. This
is what Paul meant when he said, that “by ono Spirit we are
all baptized into one body.¹' (a)

XVI. Now, if it be true,as we have stated, that a sacrament
is to be considered as received, not so much from the hand of
him hy whom it is administered, as from the hand os God
himself, from whom, without doubt, it proceeded, wo may con-
clude that it is not capable οἰ any addition or diminution from
the dignity of the person by whose hand it is delivered And
aa, among men, if a letter bo sent, provided the hand and seal
os the writer be known, it is of very little importance who and
what the earrier of it may be, ao it ought to be sufficient
for us to know the hand and soal of oni· Lord in his sacrae
ments, by whatever messenger they may be conveyed. Thia
fully refutes tha error of the Donatists, who measured the
virtue and value of the sacrament by the worthinesa of the
minister. Such, in the present day, are our Anabaptists, who
positively deny that we are rightly baptized, because we were
baptized by impious and idolatrous ministers in the kingdom
of the pope, and therefore violently urge us to ho baptized
again3 against whose follies we shall be fortified with an argu-
ment os 'uffieiont strength, if we consider that we aso baptized
not in the name of any man, but in the name of tha Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, and consequently that
it is not the baptism of man, but of God, by whomsoever it is
administered. 'though those who baptizoti us were charge-
able with the greatest ignora-nee or contempt of God and of
all religion, yet they did not baptize ua into the sollowahip of
their own ignor-anco or sacrilege, hut into the saith of Jeaus
Christ3 because they invoked, not their own name, but the
name of God, aud bnptized in no other name but hin. Now,
isit wan tho baptiam of God, it eertainly eontained tha pomis·
