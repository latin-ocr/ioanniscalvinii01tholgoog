the punishments which they would otherwise have to suffer iu
hell. And what is the design of the obita, or anniversary
obsequias, and the greater part of the messes, but that those
who all their lifetime have been the most cruel of tytanis, the
most rapacious os robbers, or abandoned to every enormity, as
if redeemed with this price, may escape the fire of purgatory?

XVI. Under the other kind of sacrifices, which we have
called tlte sacrifice ⁰s thunksgioing, are included all the offices
of charity, which when we perform to our brethreu, we honour
the Lord himself in his members; and liltewise all our prayers,
praises, thanlrsgivings, and every thing that we do in the service
of God; all which are dependent on a greater sacrifice, by which
we are consecrated in seul and body as hely templea to the
Lord. Itis not enough for our external actions to bc employed
in his service: it is necessary that first ourselves, and then all
our works, be consecrated and dedicated to him3 that what·
ever belongs to us may conduce to his glory, and discover a
zeal forits advancemerrt. This kind of sacrifice has no ten·
dancy to appease the wrath of God, to procure remissiones

pleasing to God, except from the hands of those whdm he has
already favoured with the remissiori of their sins, reconciled to
himself, and absolved from guilt; and it is so necessary to the
Ohurch as to be altogether indispensable. Therefore it will
continue to be offered for ever, as long as the people of God
shall exist3 as we have already seen from the prophet. For so
far are we from wishing to abolish it, that in that sense we are
pleased to understand the following prediction: “From‘the ris·
{ritihus{frigiditati}lthssrtftlttftltrhlt
shall be offered unto my name, and a pure offering 3 for my name
shall be great among the heathen, saith the Lord of hosts.” (r)
So Paul enjoins us to “ present'' our “bodies,a living sacri·
fiee, holy, acceptable unto God,” which is our “reasonable
service.'’ (s) He has expressed himself with the strictest pro-
priety, by adding that this is our reasonable service; for he
intended a spiritual kind of Divina worship, which he tacitly op·
posed to the carnal sacrifices of the Mosaic law. So “todo
good, and to communicate,'' are called “sacrifices with which
God is well pleased.” (t) So the liberality of the Philippians
in supplying the wants of Paul was “an odour of a sweet
smell, a sacrifice acceptable and well pleasing to God.’' (υ) So
all the good works of believers are spiritual sacrifices.
