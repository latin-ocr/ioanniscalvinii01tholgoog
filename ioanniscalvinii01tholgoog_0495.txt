of Christ ; signifying that, in having been baptized in his name, ·
they had dedicated themselves to him, had avowed him as
their Lord and Master, and had bound themselves by a solemn
obligation before men; so that they could never again confess
any other except him, unless they intended to reuounce the
confession which they had made at their baptism.

XIV. Now, as we have stated what was the design of our
Lord in the institution of baptism, it is easy to judge in what
manner we ought to use and receive it. For as it is given for
the support, consolation, and confirmation of our saith, it re·
quires to be received as from the hand of the Author himself:
we ought to consider it as beyond all doubt, that it is he who
speaks to us by this sign3 that it is he who purifica and
cleanses us, and obliterates the remembrance of our sins3 that
it is he who makes us partakers of his death, who demolishes
the kingdom of Satan, who weakens the power of our corrupt

that he as truly aiud certainly performs these things interhally
on our souls, as we see that our bodies are extemally washed,
immersed, and enclosed in water. For this analogy or simili-
tude is a most certain rule of sacraments; that in corporeal
things we contemplate spiritual things, just as ifthey were
placed before our eyes, as it has pleased God to represent them
to us by such figures: not that such blessings are bound or
enclosed iu the sacrament, or that it has the power to impert
them to us; but only because it is a sign by which the Lord
testifies his will, that he is determined to give us all these
things: nor does it merely feed our eyes with a bare prospect of
the symbols, but conducta us at the same time to the thing sig·
nified, and efficaciously accomplishes that which it represents.

XV. We may see this exemplified in Cornelius the centu-
rion, who, after having received the remission of his sins and
the visible greces of the Holy Spirit, was baptized3 not with a
view to obtain by baptism a more ample remissiou of sins, but
a stronger exercise of faith, and an increase of confidenee from
that pledge. (q) Perhaps it may be objected, “ Why, then, did
Ananias say to Paul, ‘Arise, and be baptized, and wash away
thy sins,' (r) if sins are not washed away hythe efficacy of
baptrsm itself? ’² lanswer, We are said to receive or obtain

that which our saith apprehende, as presented to us by the
Lord, whether at the time that he first declares it to us, or
When, by any subsequent testimony, he affords us a more cer·
tarn confirmation of it. Ananias, therefore, only intended to
tay to Paul, “ That thou mayest be assured that thy sins are
