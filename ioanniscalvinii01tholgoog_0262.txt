On the other hand, who would dare to give the appellationes
a Ghurch, without any exception, to that society, where the
word of God is openly and fearlessly trampled under foot;
where its ministry, the principa] sinew, and even the soul of
the Charch, is discontinued?

VIII. What, then, it will be said, was there no particle of a
Chureh left among the Jews from the moment of their defection
to idolatry? The answer iseasy. In the first place, lobserve,
that in this defection there were several degrees. Nor will wc
maintain the fall of Judah‚ and that of lsrael, to have been ex·
actly the same, at the time when they both began to depart
from the pure worship of God. When ·Jeroboam made the
calves, in opposition to the express prohibition of God, and
dedicated a place which it was not lawful to use for the oblation
of sacrifices, in this case religion was totally corrupted. The
Jews polluted themselves with practical impicties and supersti-
tions, before they made any unlawful changes in the extemal
forms of religion. For though they generally adopted many
corrupt ceremonias in the time of Rehoboam, yet aa the doctrine
of the laW, and the priesthood, and the rites which God had
instituted, were still preserved at Jerusalem, believers had
in that kingdom a tolerable form of a Ohurch. Among the
Israelites, there was no reformation down to the reign of Ahab,
and in his time there was an alteration for the worse. Of the
succeeding kings, even to the subversion of the kingdom, some
resembled Ahab, and others, who would be alittle better, followed
the example of Jeroboam; but all, without exception, were
irnpious idolaters. In Judah there were various changes; some
lrings corrupted the worship of God with false and groundless

’ superstitious, and others restored religion from its abusos ; till,

at length, the priests themselves polluted the temple of God
with idolatrous and abominable rites.

IX. Now, however the Papists may extenuata their vices, let
them deny, if they can, that the state of religion is as corrupt and
depraved among them, as it was in the kingdom of Israel, in
the time of Jeroboam. But they practice a grosser idolatry, and
their doctriua is equally, if not more, impure. God is my
witness, and all men who are endued with moderate judgment,
and the fact itself declares, that in this I am guilty of no exag-
geration. Now, when they try to drive us into the communion
of their Church, they require two things of us -first, that we
should communicate in all their prayers, sacraments, and cere·
monies3 secondly, that whatever honour, power, and jurisdic-
. tion, Christ has conferred upon his Church, we should attribute
the same to theirs. vWith respect to the first point, 1 consess
that the propheta who were at Jerusalem, when the atate of
affairs there was very corrupt, neither offered up sacrifices apert
