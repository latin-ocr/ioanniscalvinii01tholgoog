eousness, whichis no other than perfection. Now, to refrsin
srom observing that what Paul calls persectness, is the mutual
connection which subsiste between the members of a wellcon·
stituted church, and to admit that charity constitutes our per·
fection before God3 yet what new advantage will they gain?
On the contrary, Ι shall always object, that we never arrive
at that perfectiori, unless we fuliil all the branches of charity3
and hence I shall infer, that since all men are at an immense
distance from complete charity, they are destitute os all hope
of rfection

fiel. lhave no inclination to notice all the passages of Scrip-
ture, which the folly of the modern Sorbonists seizes as they
occur, and without any reason employa against us. For some
of them are so truly ridiculous, that 1 could not even mention
them, unless 1 wished to be accounted a fool. 1 shall therefore
conclude this subject after having explained a sentence uttered
by Christ, with which they ara wonderfully pleased 'I'o a
lawyer, who asked him what was necessary to salvation, he
replied‚ “ lf thou wilt enter into life, keep the command·
ments.'' (b) What can we wish more, say they, when the
Author of grace himself commanda to obtain the kingdom of
heaven by an observance of the commandments? As though
it were not evident, that Christ adopted his replies to those with
. whom he conversed. Here edoctor of the law inquires the
method of obtaining happiness, and that not simply, but what
men must do in order to attain it. Both the character of the
speaker and the inquiry itself induced the Lord to make this
reply. The inquiret, persuaded of the righteousness of the law,
possessed a blind confidence in his works. Besides, he only
inquired what were those works of righteousness by which sal-

’ , vation might be procured. Heis therefore justly referred to

the law, which contains a perfect mirror of righteousness. We
· also explicitly declara, that if life be sought by works, it isindis·
pensably requisite to keep the commandments iindthisdoctrina
is necessary to be known by Christians; for how should they
iles for refuge to Christ, if they did not acknowledge themselves
to heve fallen from the way of life upon the precipice of death?
And how could they know how far they have wandered from
the way of life, without a previous knowledge of what that
way of life is? It is then, therefore, that Christ is presented to
them as the asylum of salvation, when they perceive the vast
difference between their own lives and the Divine righteousness,
which consists in the observance os the law‚ The sum of the
whole is, that if we seek salvation by works, we must keep the
commandments, by which we are taught perfect righteousuess.
