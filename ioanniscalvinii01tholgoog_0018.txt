and debased by a mixture 01 some alloy. Let any holy servant
of God select froin his whole life that which he shall conceive
to heve beeri the best of all his actions, and let him examine it
with attention on every side 3 he will undoubtedly discover in
it some taint of the corruption of the flesh; sirice our alacrity
to good actions is never what it ought to be, but our course ia
retarded by great debility. 'Phouglr we perceive that the ble-
mishes which deform the works of the saints, are uot difficult
to be discovered, yet suppose we admit them to be very dirui·
nutive sputa, will they not be at all offensive in the sight 01 God,
iri which even the stara are not pure? We have now ascer-
tained, that there is not a single action performed by the saints,
which, if judged according to its intrinsic merit, does not Justly
deservo to be rewarded with shame.

X. In the next place, even though it were possible for us to
perform any works completely pure aud perfect, yet one siri is
sufficient to extinguish arid annihilata all remembrance 01 ante·
cedent righteousness, as is declared by the prophet. (h) With
him James also agrees: “ Whosoever shall offend,” says he,
“ in one point, he is guilty of all.'’ (i) Now, since this mortal
life is never pure or free from sin, whatever righteousness we
might acquire being perpetually corrupted, overpowered, and
destroyed by subsequent sins, it would neither be admitted in
the sight of God, nor be imputed to us 101 righteousness.
Lastly, iri considering the righteousness 01 worlts, we should
regard, not any action commanded in the law, but the com·
mandment itself. Therefore, if we seek righteousness by the
law, it isin vain 101 us to perform two or three works; a
perpetual observance 01 the law is indispensably necessary.
Wherefore God does not impute to us 101 righteousness that
remissiori 01 sins, os which we have spoken, once only, (as
some foolishly imagine) iri order that, having obtained pardon
for our past lives, we may afterwards sech righteousness by the
law; which would be only sporting with us,and deludiug us
by a fallacious hope. For since perfectiori is unattainable by
us, as long as we are in this mortal body, and the law denounces
death and judgment ori all whose works are not completely and
universally righteous, it will always have matter of accusation
and condemnation against us, unless it be prevented by the
Divina mercy continually absolving us by a perpetual remissiori
of our sins. Wherefore it will ever be true, as we asserted at
the beginning, that is we be judged according to our demerita,
whatever be our designs or tindertalrings, we are nevertheless,
with all our endeavours and all our pursuits, deserving of death
and destruction.
