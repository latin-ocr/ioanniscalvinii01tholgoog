to enable ue to stand unconquered against all temptatione. Sine
he calle debts, because we owe the penalty of them -a debt we
are altogether incapuble of discharging, unless we are released
by this remission‚ which is a pardon flowing frorn his gratui-
toue mercy, when he freely cancels these debte without any
payment from us, being satisfied by hie own mercy in Christ,
who hae once given himself for our redemption. Those, there·
fore, who rely on God'e being satisfied with their own merite, or
the merite of others, and persuade themselves that remissiori of
sins ie purchased by these satisfactione, have no interest in this
gratrntous forgivenees3 and while they call upon God in this
form, they are only subscribing their own accusation, and oven
sealing their condemnation with their own testimony. For
they confess themselves debtors, unless they are discharged by
the benefit of remission‚ which neverthelese they accept not,
but rather refusa, while they obtrude upon God their own
merite and satisfactione. For in thie way they do not implore
his marey, but appeal to hie judgment. They who amuse
themselves with dreams of perfectiori, superseding the necessity
ef praying for pardon, may have disciples whom itching ears
lead into delusions; but it must be clear that all whom they
gain are perverted from Christ, since he teaches all to consess
their guilt, and receives none but einners; not that he would
datter and encourage sins, but because he lrnew that believers
are never wholly free from the vices of their flesh, but always
remain obnoxious to the jndgmeut ot' God. lt ought, indeed,
to be the object of our desires and strenuous exertions, that,
having fully discharged every part of onr duty, we may truly
congratulate ourselves before God on being pure from every
stain; but as it pleases God to restore his image within us by
degrees, so that sorne contagiou always remeius in our flesh,
the remedy ought never to be neglected. Now, if Christ, by
the authority given him hythe Father, enjoine ue, as long as
we live, to have recourse to prayer for the pardon of guilt, who
will tolerate the new teachers, who endeavour to dazzle the
eyes ef the simple with a visionary phantom of perfect inno·
cence, and fill them with a confidence in the possibility of
their being delivered from all ein? which, according to John,
is no other than making God a liar. (a) At the same time, aleo,
these worthless men, by obliterating one article, mutilate, and
so totally invalidate, the covenant of God, in which we have
eeen our salvation is contained3 being thus guilty not only of
sacrilege by separating things so united, but also of impiety and
cruelty, by overwhelming miserable sonle with despair, and of
treachery to themselves and others, by contracting a habit of
carelessness, in diametrical opposition to the Diviue mercy.
