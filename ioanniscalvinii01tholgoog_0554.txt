speech, the bread is the body; and thereby prove themselves
to be advocates for a truly literal interpretation. lf it be object-
ed, that then the bread is Christ, aud Christ is God, they will
deny this, because it is not expressed in the words of Christ.
But they will gain nothing by their denial of it, for it is univer-
sally admitted that the whole person of Christ is offered to us
in the sacrament. Now, it would be intolerable blasphemy to
affirm of a frail and corruptible element, without any figure, that
itis Christ. laslr them whether these two propositions are
equivalent to each other—Christ is tlte Son os God, and
Bread is tlte body os Christ. lf they confess them to be differ·
cnt,—a confession which, if they hesitated, it would be easy to
extort from them, —let them say whercin the difference consists.
1 suppose they will adduce no other point of difference, than that
the broad is called tlte body in a sacramental sense. Whence it
follows, that the words of Christ are not subject to any common
rule, and ought not to be examined on the principles of grammar.
1 would likewise inquire of the inflexible champious of a literal
interpretation, whether the words attributed to Christ, by Lnlre
and Paul, “ 'I'his cup is the new testarnent in my blood,’' do
not express the same idea as the former clause, in which the
bread is called his body. Surely the same reverence ought to
be shown to one part of the sacrament as to the other; and
because brevity is obscure, the sense is elucidated hya fuller
statement. Whenever, therefore, they shall argue, from that one
word, that the bread is the body of Christ, Ι shall adduce thc
interpretation furnished by the fuller account, that it is the
testantem in his body. For shall we scel< for an expositor .
of greater fidelity or accuracy than Paul and Luke? Nor is it
my design to diminish iu the smallest degree that participation
of the body of Christ, which I have aclrnowledged is enjoyed3
my only object is, to silence that foolish obstinacy which dis·
plays itself in violent contentione about words. From the
authority of Paul and Lnlre, 1 understand the bread to be the
body of Christ, because it is the covenant in his body. If they
resist this, their contention is not with me, but with the Spirit
of God. Notwithstanding they profess to be influenced by
such reverence for the words of Christ, that they dare not un-
derstand an explicit declaration of his in a figurative sense, yet
this pretext is not sufficient to justify their pertinacious rejec·
tion of all the reasons which we allege to the contrary. At the
same time, as I have already suggested, it is necessary to un-
derstand what is meant by “the testarnent in‘the body and
blood of Christ ; ’' because we should derive no benefit from
the covenant ratified by the sacrifice of his death, if it were
not followed by that secret communication by which we be·
come one with him.
