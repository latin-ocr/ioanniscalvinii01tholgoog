exemplification of the Divino institution. For though the
bishops of those times published many canons, in which they ·
seemed to express more than had been expressed in the Holy
ScriptureS, yet they were so cautious in framing their whole
economy according to the sole standard of the word of God, that
in this respect scarcely any thing can be detected among them
inconsistent with that word. But though there might be some·
thing to be regretted in their regulations, yet because they direct·
ed their sincere and zealous efforts to preserve the institution of
God, without deviating frorn it to any considerable extent, it will
be highly useful in this place to give e brief sketch of what their
practice was. As we have stated thet there are three kinds of
ministers recommended to us in the Scripture, so the ancient
Chnrch divided all the ministers it had into three orders. For
from the order of presbytera, they chose some for pastore and
teachers; the others presided over the discipline and corrections.
To the deacons wascommitted the care of the poor arrd the dis·
tribution of the alme. Reddere and Acolytes were not names of
certain offices, but young men, to whom they also gave the name
of clergo, whom they accustomed from their youth to certain
exercises in the service of the Church, that they might better un·
deretand to what they were destined, and might enter upon their
office better prepared for it in due time ; as I shall soon show more
at large. Therefore Jerome‚ after having mentioned five orders
of the Ohurch, enumerates bishopS, presbyters, deacons, the
faithful, or believers at large, aud catechumens, or persons who
had not yet been baptized, but had applied for instruction in
the Christian saith. Thus he assigns no particular place to the
rest of the clergy and the monks.

ΙΙ. All those to whom the office of teaching was assigned,
· were denominatedpresbyters. To guard against dissension, the
general consequence of equality, the presbytera in each city
chose one of their own number, whom they distinguished by
the title of bishop, The bishop, however, was not so superior
to the rest in honour and dignity, as to have any dominion over
his colleagues3 but the functione performed by a consul in tho
senate, such as, to propose things for consideration, to collect
the votcS, to preside over the rest in the exercise of advice,
admonition, and exhortation, to regulate all the procecdings by
his authority, and to carry into execution whatever had been
decreed by the general voice 3 —such were the functione exer·

cised by the bishop in tbe assembly of the presbyters. And ·

that this arrangement was introduced by human agreement, on

account of the necessity of the times, is acknowledged by the

ancient writers themselves. Thus Jerome‚ on the Epistle to

Titus, says, “A presbyter is the seme ss abishop. And before

dissensions in religion were produced by the instigation of the
