that they shall happen, it is useless to contend about fore·
knowledge, while it is evident that all things come to pass
rather by ordination and decree.

Vll. They say it is nowhere declared in express terme, that
God decrced Adam should perish by his defection3 as though
¹ the same God, whom the Scripture represents aa doing whatever
he pleases, created the noblest of his creaturas without any
determinate end. They maintain, that he was possessed of
free choica, that he might be the author of his own fate, but
that God decreed nothing more than to treat him according to
his desert. If so wealr a scheme as this be received, what will
become of God’s omnipotenso, by which he governs all things
according to his secret courrsel, independently of every person
or thing besides? But whether they wish it or dread it, pre-
destination exhibita itself in Adam’s posterity. For the loss
of salvation by the whole race through the guilt of one parent,
was an event that did not happen by nature. What prevents
their aclmowledging concerning one man, what they reluc-
tantly grant concerning the whole species? Why should they
lose their labour in sophistical evasions? The Scripture pro·
claime, that all men were, in the person of their father, sen-
tenced to eternal death. This, not being attributable to na-
ture, it is evident must have proceeded from the wonderful
counsel of God. 'Phe perplexity and hesitation discovered
at trifles by thesepious defendere of the justice of God, aud
, their facility in overcoming great difficulties, are truly absurd.
1 inquire again, how it came to pass that the fall of Adam, in·
dependent of any remedy, should involve so many nations
with their infant children in eternal death, but because such
was the will of God. Their tongues, so loquacious on every
other point, must here be struclr dumb. It is an awful decree,
1 confess; but no one can deny that God forelmew the future
· final fate of man before he created him, and that he did fore·
know it because it was appointed by his own decree. lf any
one here attacks God’s forelrnowledge, he rashly and incon-
siderately stumbles. For what ground of accusationis there
against the heavenly Judge for not being ignorant of futurity?
lf there is any just or plausible complaint, it lies against pre-
destination. Nor should it be thought absurd to affirm, that
God not only foresaw the fall of the first man, and the ruin of
his posterity in him, but also arranged all by the determination
of his own will. Foras it belongs to his wisdom to foreknow
every thing future, so it belongs to his power to rule and govern
all things by his hand. And this question also, as wellas
others, is judiciously discussed by Augustino. “We most
wholesomely confess, what we most rightly believe, that the
aod and Lord of all things, who created every thing very
