also has attempted the same artifice; after having exhibited a
summary of what relatos to the subject, adapted to tbe capaci·
ty of the unlearned,1 will disentangle it from those sophis-
tries with which Satan hasbeen labouring to deceive the
world. ln the first place, the signs are bread and wine, which
represent to us the invisible nourishment which we receive
from the bodyand blood os Christ. For as in baptism God
regeneratas us, incorporates us into the society os his Church‚
aud makes us his children by adoption, so we have said, that
he acts towards us the part of a provident father of a family, in
constantly supplying us with food, to sustain and preserve us
in that life to which he has begotten us by his word. Now,
the only food of our souls is Christ3 and to him, therefore, our
heavenly Father invites us, that being refreshed by a participa·
tion of him, we may gain fresh vigour from day to day, till
we arrivs at the heavenly immortality. And because this
mystery of the secret union of Christ with believers is incom-
prehensible by nature, he exhibits a figure and image of it in
visible signs, peculiarly adapted to our feeble capacity ; and, as
it were, by giving tolrens and pledgcs, readers it equally as
certain to us as if we beheld it with our eyes; for the dullest
minds understand this very familiar similitude, that our souls
are nourished by Christ, just as the life of the body is supported
by bread and wine. We see, then, for what end this mystical
benediction is designed3 namely, to assure us that the body of
the Lord was once offered as a sacrifice for us, so that we may
now feed upon it, and, feeding on it, may experience within us
the efficacy of that one sacrifice ; and that his blood was once
shed for us, so that it is our perpetual drink. And this is the
import of the words of the promise annexed to it: “Take,
eat; this is my body, which is given for you.'’ 'lhe body,
therefore, which was once offered for our salvation, we are
commanded to take aud eat; that seeing ourselves made parta-
hers of it, we may certainly conclude, that the virtue of that
life-giving death will be efficacious within us. Hence, also,
he calls the cup “ the new testament,'’ or rather concnam, in
his blood. (d) For the covenant which he once ratified with
his blood, he in some measure renews, or rather continues, as
faras relates to the confirmation of our faith, whenever he pre-
sents us that sacred blood to drink.

11. From this sacrament pious souls may derive the benefit
of considerable satisfaction and confidence; because it affords
us a testimony that we are incorporated into one body with
Christ, so that whatever is his, we are at liberty to call ours.
The consequence of thiais, that we venture to aasure ourselves
