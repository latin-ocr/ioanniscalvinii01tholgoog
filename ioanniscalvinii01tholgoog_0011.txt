conceived. This is the dignity, in the confidenee of which
they must glory. But if any among them discover that in-
tegrity in their conduct which among meu has some appear·
ance of sanctity, yet, since we know that God regards not
external splendour, we must penetrate to the secret springs of
these actions, if we wish them to avail any thing to justifica·
tion. We must uarrowly examine, 1 say, from what disposi-
tion of heart these works proceed. Though a most extensive
field of observation is now before us, yet, since the subject
may be despatched iu very few words, 1 shall be as compendi-
ous as possible.

11. ln the first place, 1 do not deny, that whatever excellences
appear ιιι nubelievers, they are the gifts of God. 1 aru not
so at variance with the common opinion of mankind, as to cou-
tend that there is no differenee between the justice, moderatiori,
and equity of Titus or Trajan, and the rage, intemperance‚ and
cruelty of Caligula, or Nero, or Domitian; between the obsce·
nities of Tiberius and the contiuenee of Vespasian; and, not to
dwell on particular virtues or vices, between the observance
and the contempt of moral obligation aud positiva laws. For
so great ιι the differeuce between just and unjust, that it is
visible even in the lifeless image of it. For what order will
be left in the world, if these opposites be eonfounded together?
Such a distinction as this, therefore, between virtuous and
vicious actions, has not only been eugraveu by the Lord in
the heart of every man, but has also been frequently confirmed
by his providential dispensatiorrs. We see how he confers
many blessiugs of the present life on those who practise virtue
among men. Not that this exterual resemblance of virtue
merits the least favour from him3 but he is pleased to discover
his great esteem of true righteousness, by not permitting that
which is extcmal aud hypocritical to remain without a tem·
poral reward. Wheuce it follows, as we have just ackuow-
ledged, that these virtues, whatever they may be, or rather
images of virtues, are the gifts of God; since there is nothing
in any respect laudable which does not proceed from him.

111. Nevertheless the observation of Augustine is strictly
true -that all who are strangers to the religion of the oue true
God, however they rnay be esteemed worthy of admiration for
their reputed virtue, not only merit. uo reward, but are rather
deserviug of punishment, because they contaminate the pure
gifts of God with the pollution of their own hearts. For
