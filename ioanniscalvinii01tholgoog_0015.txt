principle from which love originatee, what righteousnesses of
works can precede it? To destroy that pestilent arrogance,
therefore, John carefully apprizes us that “ we did not first love
him.'’ (s) And the Lord had by his prophet long before taught
the same truth: “l will love them freely,'’ saith he, “ for mine
angeris turned away.”(t) ls his love was spontaneously in-
clined towards us, it certainly is not excited by works. But the
ignorant mass of mankind have only this notion of it-that no
man has merited that Christ should effect our redemption3
but that towards obtaining the possession of redemption, we
derive some assistance from our own works. But however we
may have been redeemed by Christ, yet till we are introduced
into communion with him by the calling of the Father, we are
both heire of darkness and death, and enemies to God. For
Paul teaches, that we are not purified and washed from our
pollutione by the blood of Christ, till the Spirit effects that
purification within us. (u) This is the same that Peter intends,
when he declares that the “sanctification of the Spirit '’ is
effectual “uuto obedience, arrd sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
Christ.’' (a) ls we are sprinkled by the Spirit with the blood
of Christ for purification, we must not imagine that before this
ablution we are in any other state than that of sinuers desti·
tute of Christ. We may be certain, therefore, that the com·
mencement of our salvation is, as it were, a resurrection from
death to life3 because, when “on the behalf of Christ it is
given to us to believe on him,’' (y) we then begin to experience
a transition from death to life.

Vll. The same reasoning may be applied to the second and
third classes of men in the division stated above. For the
impurity of the conscience provee, that they are neither of them
yet regenerated by the Spirit of God3 and their unregeneracy
betrays also their want of faith: whence it appears, that they
are not yet reconciled to God, or justified in his sight, since
these blessingsare only ettained by faith. What cau be per·
formed by sinncrs alienated from God, that is not execrable in
his view? Yet all the impious, and especially hypocritas, are
inflated with this foolish confidence. 'Phough they know that
their heart is full of impurity, yet if they perform any specious
actions, they esteem thern too good to bc despised by God.
Hence thet pemicious error, that though convicted of a pollnted
end impious heart, they cannot be brought to consess them-
selves destitute of righteousness; but while they acknowledge
themselves to be unrighteous, because it cannot be denicd, they
still arrogata to themselves some degree of righteousness. This
