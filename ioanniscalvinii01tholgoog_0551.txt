tution os the sacred supper, the horu was approaching, iu
which, “ strichen and smitten of God,’' he was to lis down like
aleper “without form or comeliness : '² (g) he was theu sar
from intending to display the glory of his resurrection. What
a door does this open to the error of Marcion, is the body of
Christ appeared in one place mortal and mean, and in another
was received as immortal and glorious? On their principle,
however, this happens every day, sor they are constrained to
confess that the body of Christ is visible in itself, while at the
same tIme they say that it is invisibly concealed under the
symbol of breed. And yet the promulgatore of such monstrous
absurdities are so far from being ashumed of their disgrace,
that they stigmatize us with unprovoked and enormous calum·
nies, because we refuse to subscribe to them.

XVIII. If they are determiued to fasten the body and blood
of the Lord to the bread and wine, oue must of necessity be
severed from the other. For as the bread is presented sepa·
rately from the cup, the body, being united to the breed, must
consequently be divided from the blood contained in the cup.
For when they affirm that the body is in the breed, and the
blood in the cup, while the breed and the wlne are at some
distance from each other, no sophistry will enable them to evade
this conclusion-that the body is separated from tha blood.
Their usual pretence, that the blood is in the body, and the
body iu the blood, by what they call concomitance, is perfectly
srIvolous, while the symbols in which they are contained are
so divided. But if we elevate our vIews aud thoughts towards
heaven, to seek Christ there in the glory of his kingdom, as
the symbols iovite us to him entire, under the symbolos
breed we shall eat his body, under the symbol of wine we
shall distinctly drink his blood, so that we shall thus enjoy
him entire. For though he has removed hisilesh from us,
and in his body is escended to heaven, yet he sits at the
Father’s right hand, that is, he reigns iu the power, and
majesty, and glory of tha Father. This kmgdom is neither
limited to any local space, nor circumscribed by any dimen-
sions; Christ exeris his power wherever he pleases ln heaven
and earth, exhibits himself present in hle energetic intluence,
is constantly with his people, inspiring his lile Into them, lives

in them, sustains them, strengthens and invigorates them, just
as is he were corporeally present3 ln short, he feeds them with
his own body, of which he gives them a participation by the
influence of his Spirit. This is the way iu which the body
and blood os Christ are exhibited to usin the sacrament.

XIX. It is necessary for us to establish surh a presence of

macomus.
