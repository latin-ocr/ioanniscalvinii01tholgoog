dent that among the promises themselves one is confirmed by
another? For in proportion to ite superior clearness, it is the
better calculated for the support of seith. Now, the saei-aments
bring us the cleareet promises, and have this peculiarity beyond
the word, that they give us a lively representation of then-i, as
in ι picture. Nor ought we to regard the objection, frequently
urged, from the distinction between sacramente and seals of
oivil instrumente, that while they both eonsist of the carnal
elements of this world, the former cannot be fit to eeal the
promises os God, which are spiritual and eternel, aa the latter
are accustomed to be appended to eeal the edicts os princes
relative to frail and transitory things. For the believer, when
the sacramente are placed before his eyes, does not confine
himself to that carnal speetacle3 but by those steps of analo—
gy which 1 have indicated, risos in pious contemplation to
the sublime mysteries which are concealed under the sacra-
menta-l symbols⁴

vl. And since the Lord calls his promises emmanu, und the
sneraments sealt of menania, we may draw a similitude from
the covenants of men. The ancients, in confirmation os their
ongagernents, were uccustomed to kill a sow. But what would
have been the elaughter of a eow, if it had not been accom-
ponied, und even preceded, hy some words? For sows were of-
ten slaughtered without any latent or sublime mysteryi What
is the contaet of one man‘s right hand with that of another,
uince hands are not unfrequently joined in hostility? But
when words of friendship and compunt have preceded, the ob-
ligations of covenants ore confirmed by such signs, notwith—
standing they have been previously conceived, proposed, and
determine-1 in words* Sacraments, therefore, are exercisee,
which ineram and strengthen our saith in the word of God3
and because we are corporeal, they are exhibited under eor·
poreal symbols, to instructus according to our dull capecities,
and to lead us by the lund as eo many young ohildmn, For
this remon Augustine calle a sacrament ¹‘ a visible word ς ” be-
cause it represents the promises of God portrayed as in e pic-
ture, and places before our eyes an image os them, in which
every lineumont is strikingly expressed. Other similitudes may
also be edduced sor the better elucidation of the nature of
aacmuents, u if we cell them pilton of mar saith f for as an
edifice rests on its foundation, aud yet, from the addition of
pillars placed under it, receives en increase of stability, so saith
rests on the word of God as its foundation; but when the
sacramenta are added to it as pillum, they bring with thern en
accession of rtrength. Or if we eall them πηός-Νη, in which
