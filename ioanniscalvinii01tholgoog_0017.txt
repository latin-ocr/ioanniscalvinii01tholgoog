their works ιο ιιιοιίι the favour of God. But by such means
they will add provocation ιο provocation3 for “the sacrifice of
the wicked isan abomination to the Lord, but the prayer of
the upright'‘ alone “is his delight.’'(c) We lay lt down,
therefore, as an undoubted truth, which ought ιο be well known
ιο such as are but moderately versed in the Scripturas, that
even the most splendid worlrs of men not yet truly sanctified,
are sofar from righteousness in the Divine vieW, that they are
accounted sins. And therefore they have strictly adhered to
the truth, who have maintained that the worlrs of a man do
ιιοι conciliate God’s favour to his person; but, on the contrary,
that works are never acceptable to God, unless the person who
performs them has previously found favour in his sight. And
this order, ιο which the Scripture directs us, is religiously to be
observed. Moses relatos, that “'l'he Lord had respect nuto
Abel and ιο his offering.'’ (d) Does he ιιοι plainly indicate
that the Lord is propitious ιο men, before he regards their
worksl Wherefore the purification of the heart is a necessary
prerequisite, in order that the works which we perform may be
favourably received by God; for the declaration of Jeremiah is
always in force, that the “eyes of the Lord are upon the
truth.” (e) And the Holy Spirit has asserted by the mouth of
Peter, that it is “by faith” alone that the “beart’' is “pu-
rified,'’ (s ) which proves that the first foundation is laid in a

- true and living saith.

IX. Let us now examine what degree of righteousness is
possessed by those whom we have ranked in the fourth class.
We admit, that when God, by the interpositiones the right·
eonsness of Christ, reconciles us to himself, and having granted
us the free remissiori of our sins, esteems us aa righteous per·
sons, to this mercy he adds also another blessing; for he dwells
in us by his Holy Spirit, by whose power our carnal desisse
are daily more and more mortified, and we are sanetified‚ that
is, consecrated to the Lord unto real purity of life, having our
hearts monlded ιο obey his law, so that it is our prevailing in·
clination ιο submit to his will, and to promote his glory alone by
all possible means. But even while, under the guidance of the
Holy Spirit, we are wallring in the ways of the Lord, -that we
may not forget ourselves, and be filled with pride, we feel such
remeius of imperfectiones afford us abundant cause sor hu·
mility. 'Phe Scriptnre declares, that “ there is nota just man
upon earth, that doeth good and sinneth not.'’ (g) What kind
of righteousness, then, will even believers obtain from their own
works? ln the first place, Ι essert, that the best of their per·
fonnances are tarnished and corrupted by some carnal impurity,
