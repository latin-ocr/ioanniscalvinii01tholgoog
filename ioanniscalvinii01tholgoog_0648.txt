iu tho reproach east upon his ministry? And in lect they do
not reject magistrates, bnt they reject God, “that he should
not reign over them.'' (t) For is this was truly asserted by the
Lord respecting the people os Israel, because they refused the
government os Samuel, why shall it not now be affirured with
equal truth of those who take the liberty to outrage all the
authorities which God has instituted? But they object that
our Lord said to his disciples, “The kings os the Gentiles
exercise lordship over them: bnt ye shall not be so; but he
that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger ; and he
that is chief, as he that doth serve : '' (e) and they contend that
these words prohibit the exercise os royalty, or any other
authority, by any Christiane. Admirable expositors! Α con·
tention had arisen among the disciples “which os them should
be accounted the greatest.’' To repress this vain ambition,
our Lord taught them that their ministry was not like temporol
kingdomS, in which one person has the preeminence over all
others. Now, what dishonour does this comparison cast upon
regal dignityl What does it prove at all, except that the regal
office is not the apostolic ministry? Moreover‚ though there
are various forms os magistracy, yet there is uo difference in
this respect, but we ought to receive them all as ordinances ot'
God. For Paul comprehends them all together, when he says,
that “there is no power bnt of God3 '’ and that which was
furthest from giving general satisfaction, is recommended to us
in a remarkable manner beyond all others ; namely, the gevem-
ment of one man; which, es it is attended with the common
servitude os all, except the single individual to whose will all
others are subjected, has never been so highly approved by
heroic and noble miuds. But the Scripture, on the contrary,
to correct these uujust sentiments, expressly affirms, that itis
hythe providence of Divine wisdom that kings reign, and par·
ticularly commands us to “honour the king.'’ (w)

VIII. And sor private men, who have no authority to delibe-
rate on the regulation of any public affairs, it would surely be
a vain occupatiori to dispute which would be the best serm of
government in the place where they live. Besides, this could
not be simply determined, as an abstract question, without
great impropriety, since the principle to guide the decision
must depend on circumstances. And even if we compare the
different forms together, without their circumstances, their ad-
vantages are so nearly equal, that it will not be easy to discover
ol which the utility preponderates. The forms of civil govern-
ment are considered to be of three kinds: Monarchy, which is
