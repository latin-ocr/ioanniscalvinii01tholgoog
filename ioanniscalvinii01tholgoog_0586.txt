can present to God, is to offer him our vileness and unworthi·
hess, that he may make us worthy of his mercy; to despair in
ourselves, that we may find consolation in him; to humble
ourselves, that we may be exalted by him; to accuse ourselves,
that we may be justified by him; likewise to aspire to that
unity which he enjoins upon us in his supper; and as he
makes us all to be one in himself, so it should be our desire
that we may all have one mind, one beart, and one tongue.
lf we have these things well considered and digested in our
minds, though we may be disturbed‚ we shall never be sub·
verted by such reflectione as this: Needy and destitute of
every good, defiled with the pollution of sin, and half dead,
how could we worthily eat the Lord's body? We shall rather
consider, that wc come as paupers to the liberal Benefactor, as
patients to the Physician, as sinuers to the Author of right-
eousness, as persons dead to the fountain of life ; that the wor-
thiness which is required by God consists prinprally in saith,
which attributes every thing to Christ, and places no de·
pendence on ourselves, and, secondly, in charity, even that
charity which it is enough for us to present to God inan im·
perfect state, that he may increase and improve it; for we
cannot produce it in a state of perfectiori. Others, who have
agreed with us that the worthiness which is enjoined consists
in faith and charity, have nevertheless fallen into a consider·
able error respecting the degree of that worthiness, requirIng a
perfectiori of saith to which nothing carr ever approach, and a
charity eqnal to that which Christ has manifested toward us.
But by this requisition they exclude all men from access to
this sacred supper, as much as the persons to whom we ad·
verted before. For if their opinion were admitted, no person
could receive it, but unworthily3 since all, without a single
exception, would be convinced of their imperfectiori. And
surely it must betray extreme ignorance, not to say stupidity,
to require in the reception of the sacrament, that perfectiora
which would render the sacrament unnecessary and useless;
for it was not instituted for the perfect, but for the imperfect
and feeble, to awahen, excite, stImulate, and exercise their
graces of faith and charity, and to correct the defecta of both.
XLIII. With respect to the external ceremonial‚ whether
believers take the bread in their hands or not ; whether they
divide it between thern, or every individual eat that which is
given to him; whether they return the cup into the hand of
the deacon, or deliver it to the person who is riex=t3 whether

the bread be leavened or unleavened; whether the wine be red

or white3 is not of the least importance. These things are in-

different, and left to the liberty of the Church. It is certain,

however, that the custom of the ancient Church was, that every
