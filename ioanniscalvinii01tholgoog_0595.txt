ΙΙ. Let us proceed, therefore, to establish what we have
asserted, in the first place, that the mass offers an intolerable
blasphemy and insult to Christ. For he was constituted by
his Father a priest and a high-priest, not fora limited time, like
those who are recorded to have been consecrated priests under
the Old Testament, who, having a mortal life, could not have an
immortal priesthood; wherefore, there was need of successore,
from time to time, to fill the places of those who died ; but Christ,
who is inimortal, requires no vicar to be substituted in his ploee.
Therefore he was designated by the Father as “ a priest for ever,
after the order of Melchisedec 3 '' that he might for ever execute
a permanent priesthood. This mystery had long before been
prefigured in Melchisedec, whom the Scriptura has introduced
once as “the priest of the Most High God,'' but never mentions
him afterwards, as if there had been no end to his life. From
this resemblance Christ is called a priest after his order. (t)
Now, those who sacrifice every day must necessarily appoint
priests to conduct the oblations‚ and those priests must be
substituted in the room of Christ, as his successore and vicars.
By this substitution they not only despoil Christ of his due
honour, and rob him of the prerogative of an eternsl priesthood,
but endeavour to degrade him from the right hand of the
Father, where he cannot sit in the enjoyment of immortality,
unless he also remain an eternal priest. Nor let them plead
that their sacrificing priests are not substituted in the place of
Christ, as though he were dead, but are merely assistants in
his eternal priesthood, which does not, on this account, ceasc
to remain; for the language of the apostle is too precise for
them to avail themselves of such an evasi0n; when he says
that “they truly were many priests, because they were not
suffered to continue by reason of death.’' (u) Christ, therefore,
whose continuance is not prevented by death, is only one, and
needs no companions. Yet they have the effrontery to arm
themselves with the example of Melchisedec in defence of
their impicty. For, because he is said to have “brought forth
bread and wine,'’ they conclude this to have been a prefigu-
ration of their mass, as though the resemblance between him
and Christ consisted in the oblation of bread and wine; which
is too unsubstsntial and frivolous to need any refutation. Mel-
chisedec gave bread and wine to Abraham and his companions,
to refresh them when they were fatigued on their return from
