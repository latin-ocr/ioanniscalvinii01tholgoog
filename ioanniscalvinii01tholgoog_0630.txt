Holy Spirit3 though, in truth, that prophet mentions only six,
and hed no intention 01 enumerating them all in that passage ;
101 in other passages of scripture, he is called “the Spirit 01
1110, 01 holiness, and of adoption, '' as he is there called “the
Spirit 01 wisdom and understandiug, the Spirit of oounsel
and might, the Spirit 01 knowledge, and 01 the 1001 01 the
Lord.” (f) Other persons 01 greater subtlety limit not 1110
orders to seven, but extend them 10111110, 111 resemblance, they
say, 01 the 011111011 triumphant. And they are 1101 agreed
among themselves3 for sorne represent the clerioal tonsure 10 be
the 11101 011101 01 011, and the episcopale the last: others exclude
the tonsure, arrd place the archiepiscopal office among the
orders. Isidore distinguishes them in a different way; for he
makes psalmists and readers two separate orders, appointing
the former 10 the chantiugs, and the latter 10 the reading of
the 8011110100, 101 the instruction 01 the people. And this
distinction is observed in the canons. In such a diversity,
what do they wish us to pursue or 10 avoid? Shall we say
that there are seven orders? So 10001100 the master 01 the
sentences, Lombard ; but the most illuminated doctors deter-
mine otherwise; and these doctors differ among themselves.
Moreover, the most sacred canons call 110 another way. This
is the harmony exhibited hymen, when they disonss Divino
subjeots without the word 01 God.

XXlIl. But this surpasses all fully, that in every one of
their orders they make Christ acolleague with them. First,
they say, he executed the office of beadle, when he made 0
whip 01 0111011 cords, and drove 011 the buyers and 0011010 out
01 the temple. He shewed himself 10 be a beadle, when he said,
“I arn the door.’' He assumed the place of a render, when he
read a passage 01 1001011 111 the synagogue. He discharged the
function 01 011 01010101, when, applying spittle to the ears and
tongue 01 0 man who was (10111 and dumb, he restored his hear-
ing and speech. He deelared himself to be 011 acolothist iu
these words: “ He that followeth me shall not walk in dark-
ness.'' He discharged the duty of a subdeacon, when he
girded himself with a lowel, and washed the feet 01 his disci·
ples. He sustained the character 01 adeacon‚ when he dis·
tributed his body and blood in the supper. He acted the part
010 1111001, when he offered himself on the 01000 0 sacrifice 10
the Father. 11 10 impossible 10 hear these things without
laughing, so that 1 wonder they were written without laughing;
at least, 11 those who wrote thern were men. But the most
remarkable 01 all is, the subtlety with which they reason 011
the word acolothist, which they eall ceroferarius, a tapet-
bearet ς atenn of magio, Ι suppose, certainly unknown in any
