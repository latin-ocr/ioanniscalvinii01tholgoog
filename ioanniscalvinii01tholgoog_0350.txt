ot' heavenly doctrine, from this sountain the prophets them·
salves drew all the celestial eracles which they spolie and
wrote. But this wisdom has not always marriiested itsels itr

the same way. With the patriarcha God employed secret ’

revelations; sor the confirmation os which, however, he at the
same time added such signs that they could not entertain the
least doubt that it was God who spalre to them. What the
patriarchs had received, they transmitted from hand to hand to
their posterity; sor the Lord had committed it to them on tha
express condition that they should so propagate it. Succeed·
ing generations, srom the testimony os uod in their hearts,
knew that what they heard was srom heaven, and not from
the earth.

VI. But when it pleased God to raise up a more visible form
oi a church, it was his will that his word should be committed
to writing, in order that the priests might derive from it what·
ever they would communicate to the people, and that all the
doctrine which should be delivered might be examined by that
rule. Theresore, aster the promulgation ot' the law, when tha
priests were commanded to teach “out ot⁴ the mouth os the
Lord,'' the meaning is, that they should teach nothing extrane-
ous, or different from that system of doctrine which the Lord
had comprised in the law; it was not lawsul for them to add to
it or to diminish from it. Afterwards followed the prophets,
by whom God published new oracles, which were to be added
to the law; yet they were not so new but that they proceeded
from the law, and bore a relation to it. For in regard to doc·
trine, the propheta were merely interpreters os the law, and
added nothing to it except prophecies os things to come. Ex·
cept these, they brought forward nothing but pure explication
of the law. But because it pleased God that there should be a
more evident and copions doctrine, for the better satisfactiones
weak consciences, he directed the prophecies also to be com·
mitted to writing, and to be accounted a part os his word. To
these lilrewise were added the histories, which were the pro·
ductions ot the prophete, but composcd under the dictatiou
of the Holy Spirit. lclass the Psalms with the prophecies,
because what we attribute to the prophecies is common to the
Psalms. That whole body of Scriptura, therefore, consisting
os the Law, the Prophets, the Psalms, and the Historias, was
the word os God to the ancient Ohurch3 and to this stand·
ard the priests and teachers, even to the coming of Christ,
were bound to conform their doctrine; nor was it lawsul sor
them to deviato either to the right hand or to the left, because
their office was wholly confined within these limite, that they
should answer the people from the mouth os God. And this
may be inferred from that remarkable passage οἱ Malachi,
