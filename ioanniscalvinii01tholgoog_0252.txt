she go from him, and become another mau’s, shall 1181818111
unto her again? Shall not that laud be greatly polluted? But
thou hast played the harlot with many lovers, and thou hast
polluted the land with thy whoredoms and with thy wicked·
ness. Yet return again tome, thou backsliding Israel, saith
the Lord, and l will not cause mine auger to sall upon you3
18118111 mercisul, saith the Lord, and will not keep anger sor
ever.'' (a) And surely there cannot possibly be any other dis·
position in him who affirms, that he “ hath no pleasure iu the
death 811118 wicked, but that the wicked 1811111881 1118 way
aud live.” (w) Theresore, when Solomon dedicated the temple,
he appointed it also for this purpose, that prayers‚ offered to
obtain pardon 81 81118, might there be heard and answered.
His words are, “ 11 they sin against thee, (forthere 18 118 man
that sinneth not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver
them to the enemy, so that they carry them away captives
unto the land 81 1118 enemy, sar or near; yet 11 they shall be-
think themselves, and repent in the land whither they were
carried captives, and repent and make supplication unto thee
in the land 81 111888 that carried them captiveS, saying, We have
sinned, and have done perversely‚ we have committed wicked·
ness; and pray unto thee toward the land which thou gavest
unto their fathers, the city which thou hast chosen, and the
house which 1 have built 181 thy name; then hear thou their
prayer and their supplication in heaven, and forgive thy people
that have sinned against thee, and all their transgressibus
wherein they have transgressed against thee.'' (a) Nor was it
without cause that in the law the Lord ordained daily sacrifices
181 81118 ; 181 unless he had foreseen that his people would be
subject to the maladies of daily sins, he would never have ap·
pointed these remedies. (y)

XXVI. Now,l ask whether, by 1118 advent 81 Christ, in*
whom the fuluess 81 grace was displayed, believers have been
deprived 81 11118 11888111, 88 11181 they 8811 118 longer presume to
supplicate 1811118 pardon 81 their sins; so that 11 they offend
against the Lord, they 8811 obtain no mercy. What would
this be but to affirm, that Christ came sor the destruction 81 his
people, and 1181181 their salvati0n; 11 the loving·kindness 81
God, in the pardon 81 sins, which was continually ready to be
exercised 18 1118 saints under the Old Testament, be maintained
to be now entirely withdrawn? But 11 we give any credit to

his mercy has been abundantly diffused, and reconciliation
