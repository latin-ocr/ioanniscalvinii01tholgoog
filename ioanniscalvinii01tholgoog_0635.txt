we are all priests3 but it is only 10 offer 1ο God praises and
thanksgivings‚ in short, ourselves and all that belongs to us.
11 was 1110 province alone, by his oblation, 10 0000000 God and
expiate sins. When these men usurp that office 10 themselves,
what follows, but that their priesthood is chargeable with
impiety and sacrilege? 'Phey certainly betray the greatest
effrontery when they dare to dignisy it with the title 01 0 sa-
01010001. Τ110 101000111οο 01 1100110, which is used 01 the intro-
duction 01 1110 true presbyters and ministers 01 the Church
into their office, I have no objection to consider as 00001010001;
sor, in the first place, that ceremony is taken 110111 1110 scripture,
and, in the 11011 01000, 11 10 1100101011 by Paul to be not unne-
000001110111001000,110101011111111 symbol of spiritual grace. (i)
Ihave 001 enumerated it as 1110 third among the sacramenta,

’ because it is not ordinary or common 10 011 believers, but a
special rite 101 0 particular office. The ascriptiou 01 11110
honour to the Christian ministry, however, furnishes 00 reason
1011110 pride 01 Romish priests, 101 Christ has commanded the or·
dination 01 0110101010 10 dispenso his gospel and liis mysteries,
not the inauguration 01 priests to offer 0001111000. 110 has coru·
missioned them to preach the gospel 0011 10 10011 his flock, 0011
001 10 immolate victims. He has promised them the grace 01
1110 Holy Spirit, not in order to effect an expiation 1010100, but
rightly 100001010001100011001 the government 01 1110 Ohurch.
XXIX. 'l'here is 00 excellent correspondence between the
ceremonias and the thing itself. Our Lord, when he 0001 101111
1110 1110010100 10 preach the gospel, “ breathed upon thern ; ” (10) by
that symbol representing the power 01 1110 Holy Spirit which he
imparted 10 111010. 'I'hese sapient theologues retain 1110110011-
ing, and, as 11 they disgorged 1110 Hol y Spirit 11010 111011 11110010,
they mutter over the priests whom they ordain, Recet've yc 1110
Holy Ghost. Thus they leave nothing that they do 001 pre-
posterously counterfeit,l do not say like comedians, whose ges-
ticulations are 001 without art and meaning, but like apes, who
imitate every thing without any 10010 01 design. We observo,
they say, the example 01 our Lord. But our Lord did many
things which he never intended to be 0110100100 10 110. Ηο said
to his disciples, “Receive ye the Holy Ghost.’¹ He said 10
Lazarus, ‘¹ Lazarus, Corne 101111.”(1) Ηο said 10 1110 paralytic,
“Α1100 and walk.” (m) Why do not they say the same 10 all
deceased persons and paralytice? When he breathed upon his
apostles, and filled themwith the grace 01 1110 Holy Spirit, he
exhibited 0 specimen 01 1110 Divinc power. 11 they attempt 10
110 1110 same, they emulate uod, and, as it were, challenge him
10 00010011 with them; but they are very 10111010 producing
