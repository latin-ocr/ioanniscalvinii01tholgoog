it to the Spirit. One passage shall suffice instead of many.
In the eighth chapter os the Epistle to the Romans, Paul
represents Christ as dwelling in us no otherwise than by his
Spirit. (w) By this representation, the apostle does not destroy
that communion of the body and blood of Christ of which we
we are now treating, but teaches that it is solely owing to the
ageney of the Spirit that we possess Christ with all his benefits,
aud have him dwelliug within us.

Xlll. Deterred by a horror of such barbarons impiety, the
schoolmen have expressed themselves in more modest language,
yet they only trifle with equal fallacy aud greater subtlety.
They admit that Christ is not contained in the bread and
wine iu a local oreorporeal manner 3 but they afterwards iuvent
amanuer which they neither understand themselves uor ean
explain to others; which, however, amounts to this, that Christ
isto be sought, as they express it, in the form os bread.
When they say that the substance of bread is transmuted into
Christ, do they not attach his substance to the whiteuess,
which they pretend is all that remains of the bread? But,
they say, he is so contained in the sacrament, that he remairm
in heaven, and we maintain no other presence thau that of
habitudo. But whatever words they employ to gloss over
their notions, they all terminate in thie, that, by the couse-
cration, that which was before bread becomes Christ, so that
the substance of Christ is concealed under the colour of breed.
This they are not ashamed to express in plain terms; for
Lombard says, “ That the body of Christ, which is visible iu
itself, is hidden and concealed, afterthe consecration, under the
form of bread.’' Thus the figure of the bread is nothing but a
vell, which preventa the flesh from being scen. Nor is there
any need of many conjectures, to discover what suares they
intended to lay in these words, which the thing itself plainly
evinces. For it is evident in what prosouud superstition not
only the people in general, but even the principal meu, have

now for several ages been involved, and are involved, at the ·

present day, in the Papal churches. True saith, which is the
sole medium of our uniou and communion with Christ, being
an object of little solicitude to thern, provided they have
that carnal presence which they have fabricated without any
authority from the Divine word, they consider himas suffi-
ciently present with them. The consequence of this inge·
nious subtlety, therefore, we find to be thiatbat bread hasbeen
taken for God.

for which they now contend with more earnestuess thau for all
