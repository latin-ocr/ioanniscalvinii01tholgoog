itsels, by which the members of Christ are regenerated with
their Head, is not common to all.'’ Again, in another place,
speaking of the lord's supper: “We also in the present day
receive visible meat ; but the sacrament is one thing, and the
power of the sacrament is another. How is it that many
receive os the altar and die, and die in consequence of receiv-
ingi For the morsel of bread given by the Lord to Judas was
poison; not because ludas received an evil thing, but because,
being a wicked man, he received a good thing in a sinful
manner.” A little aster: “ 'Phe sacrament of this thing, that
is, of the unity of the body and blood os Christ, is prepared on
the table of the Lord, in some places daily, in other places on
appointed days, at stated intervals of time3 and is thence re·
ceived, by some to lise, by others to destruction. But the thing
signified by this sacrament is received, not to destruction, but
to life, by every one who partakes os it.'’ He had just before
said, “He shall not die, who eats3 l refer not to the visible
sacrament, but to the power of the sacrament; who eats inter·
nally, not externally3 he who eats in his beart, not he who
presses with his teeth.’' ln all these passages we find it main·
tained, that a sacrament is separated from the truth signified in
it, hythe unworthiness of a person who receives it amiss, so
that there is nothing lest in it but a vain and useless figure.
In order-to enjoy the thing signified together with the sign,
and not a mere sign destitute of the truth it was intended to
convey, it is necessary to apprehend by saith the word which is
contained in it. Thus, in proportion to the communion we
have with Christ by means of the sacramente, will be the ad·
vantage which we shall darive from them.

XVI. ls this be obscure in consequence of its brevity, l will
explain it more at large. 1 affirm that Christ is the matter, or
substance, of all the sacraments; since they have all their solidi·
ty in him, and promise nothing ont of him. So much more
intolerable is the error of Peter Lombard, who expressly makes
them causes of righteousness and salvation, of which they are
parts. Leaving all causes, therefore, of human invention, we
ought to adhere to this one cause. As far as we are assisted
by their instrumentality, to nourish, confirm, and increase our
saith in Christ, to obtain a more perfect possession of him
and an enjoyment os his riches, so far they are efficacious to
us; and this is the case when we receive by true saith that
which is offered in them. Do the impious, then, it will be
said, by their ingratitude, frustrate the ordinance of God, and
cause it to corne to nothing? 1rep1y, that what 1 have said is
not to be understood as implying, that the virtue and truth os a
sacrament depends on the condition or choica of him who re-
ceives it. For what God has instituted continues tmshalrem
