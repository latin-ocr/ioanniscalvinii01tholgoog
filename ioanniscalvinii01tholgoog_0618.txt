warfare, if this be not? If they deemed it of no importance to
trample under font the word 01 God, why did they not 01 least
reverence the Church, 10 which they wish· to appear so uni·
formly obsequious? But what can be produced more severe
against this doctrine of theirs, than the following decree 01 100
Conncil of Milevum? “ Whoever asserts that baptism is only
given for the remissiones 0100, and not for assistance 01 future
grace, let him be accursed.’' When Lake, in a passage which
we have already cited, speaks of some as having been “bap-
tized in the name of the Lord Jesus,’' (s) who had not received
the Holy Ghost, he does not absolutely deny that any gift 01
the Spirit had been imparted to those persons who had believed
in Christ with the beart, and had confessed him with the
mouth ; he intends that gift of the Spirit which communi-
cated his manifest powers and visible graces. So 100 apostles
are said to have received the Holy Spirit on the day 01 Ρο010-
cost; though Christ had long before declared 10 them, “It
is not ye that speak, bnt the Spirit of your Father, which
speaketh in you.”(t) Let all who are of God, herc observe
the malicious and pestilent artifice 01 Satan. That which was
trttly given in baptism, he falsely asserts 10 00 given in his
confirmation, with the crafty design of seducing ns nnawares
from baptism. Who can doubt, now, that this is the doctrine
01 Satan, which severs from baptism the promises which belong
to that sacrament, and transfers them to something else? lt
is now discovered on what hind 01 0 foundation this famous
unctiori rests. The word 01 God is, that “as many as have
been baptized into Christ, have put on Christ,'' (a) with his
gifts. The word 01 these anointers 10, That wc have received
no promise in baptism to arm us 101 100 spiritual warfare. The
word 01 God is the voice oftrnth; consequently the word 01 100
000101οτ0 must be the voice 01 falsehood. 1 can, therefore, give
0 more correct definition of this confirmation than they have
yet given of it; namely, that it is amanifest insult against bap-
tism, obscuring and even abolishing its nse; that it is 0 (100011-
101 promise 01 100 devil, seducing ns from the truth 01 God; 01,

hood of the devil, 10 darken and deceive the minds of the simple.

IX. They further assert 1001 011 believers after baptism
ought to· receive the Holy Spirit by imposition 01 hands, that
they may be found complete Christians; for that no one can
be altogether 0 Christian who is never ancinted with episcopal
confirmation. These are their own words. But Ι thought
that all things relating 10 Christianity had been comprehended
and declared in the Scriptures. Now, it seems, the true form
