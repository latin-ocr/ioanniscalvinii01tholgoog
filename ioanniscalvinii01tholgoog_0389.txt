with new observamus, or the worship of God contaminated
with human inventione. Resides, if there be any credit
ducto ancient historica and recorda, the apostles not only
never knew, but never even heard of that which is ascribed to
them. Nor let it be pretended, that the greatest pert of their
Constitutione were received in use and commonly practised‚
which were never committed to writing; namely, those things
which, during the life of Christ, they were not able to under·
stand, but which after his ascension, they learned from the
revelation of the Holy Spirit. The meaning of that passage
we have already examined. With respect to the present sub-
ject, we may observa, they make themselves truly ridiculous
by maintaining that those great mystaries, which were so long
unknown to the apostles, consisted partly of Jewish or heathen
ceremonias, of which the former had long before been promul-
gated among the Jews, and the latter among the heathen, and
partly of foolish gesticulatione and unmeaning rites, which
stupid priests, who scarcely know how to walk or speak, per-
forrn with the greatest exactness, and which even infanta and
fcols counterfeit so well, that it might be thought there wera
no more suitable ministare of such solemnities. If there were
no historias, yet men of scund judgrnent would conclude from
the thing itself, that such a vast multitude of ritas and obser·
vances did not break into the Ghurch all on a sudden, but that
they must have been introduced by degrees. For when those
lroly bishops, who were the immediate successore of the apos·
tles‚ had made some appointments relating to order and disci-
pline, they were followed by a series of others, who had too
little consideration, and too much curiosity and cupidity, of
whom every one in succession vied with his predecessore, from
a foolish emulation to excel them in the invention of new
observances. And because there was danger that their inven-
tions, by which they desired to obtain the praises of posterity,
might in a short time be di'sused, they were themora rigid in
enforcing the observance of them. This foolish and perverse
imitation hasbeen the source of most of those ritas which the
Romanists urge upon usas apostolic. And this is also attested
by various historias.

XIX. To avoid too much prolixity in composing a catalogue
of them all, we shall content ourselves with one example. In
the administrationes the Lord’s supper, the apostles used
great simplicity. Their immediate successore, to adorn the
dignity of the mystery‚ added some forms which were not to
be altogether condemned. Afterwarda followed those foolish
imitatore, who, by adding various fragments from time to time,
at length formed those vestments ct‘ the priests, those ornaments
of tha altar, those gesticulatione, and all that apparatus of use·
