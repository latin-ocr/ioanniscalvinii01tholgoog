XII. lf any person will attentively examine, he will observe
this distinction clearly marked by the word of the Lord‚ be-
tween the Mosaic sacrifices and our eucharist3 that though
those sacrifices represented to the Jewish people the sarna effi·
cacy of the death of Christ which is now exhibited to usin the
Lord's supper, yet the mode of representation was different.
For the Jewish priests were commanded to prefigure the sacri-
fice which was to be accomplished by Christ ; a victim was
presented in the place of Christ himself ; there was an altar on
which it was to be immolated; in short, every thing was con·
ducted in such a manner as to set before the eyes of the people
a representation of the sacrifice which was to be offered to God
as an atonement for sins. But since that sacrifice has been
accomplished, the Lord has prescribed to us a different method,
in order to communicate to believers the benefit of the sacrifice
which hasbeen offered to him by his Son. 'Pherefore lte has
given us a table at which we are to feast, not an altar upon
which any victim is to be offered: he has not consecrated
priests to offer sacrifices, but ministers to distributo the sacred
banquet. In proportion to the superior sublimity and sanctity
of the mystery, with the greater care and reverence it ought to
be treated. The safest course, therefore, is to relinquish all
the presumption of human reason, and to adhere strictly to
what the Scripture enjoins. And surely, if we consider that it
isthe supper of the Lord‚ and not of men, there is no cause
why we should suffer ourselves to be moved a hair’s breadth
from the scriptural rule by any authority of men or prescription
of years. Therefore, when the apostle was desirous of puri·
fying it from all the faults which hed already crept into the
Church at Corinth, he adopted the best and readiest method,
by recalling it to the one original institution, which he shows
ought to be regarded as its perpetual rulo.

Xlll. 'Phat no wrangler may take occasion to oppose us
from the terms sacristae and priest, l will briefly state what l
have meant by these tenns all through this argument. Some
extend the word sacrifice to all religious ceremonies and ac·
tions; but for this l see no reason. We know that, by the
constant usage of the Scripture, the word sacrefice is applied to
what the Greeks call sometimes burra, sometimes rporpoga, and
sometimes τελετη, which, taken generally, comprehends whatever
is offered to God. Wherefore it is necessary for us to make a
distinction, but such a distinction as may be consistent with
the sacrifices of the Mosaic law; under the shadows of which
the Lord designed to represent to his people all the truth of
spiritual sacrifices. Though there were various kinds of them,
yet they may all be referred to two classes. For either they

were oblatione made for siu in a way of satisfaction, by w‘ . ΙΙΙ
