me not very consonant to the meaning of Christ; for if we did
not ascribe to God the character of our Supporter even iu this
transitory life, our prayer would be defective. 'Phe reason which
they allega has too much profanity; that it is unbecoming for
the children of God, who ought to be spiritual, not only ιο
devote their own attention ιο terrestrial cares, but also to in·
volve God in the same anxieties with themselves3 as though,
truly, his benediction and paternal favour were not conspicuous
even in our sustenanc03 or there were ιιο meaning in the
amartion, that “godliness bath promise of the life that now is,
aud of that which is to come.” (p) Now, though remissiou of
sins is of much greater velue than corporeal alimenta, yet
Christ has given the first place ιο the inferior blessing, that he
might gradually raiae us to the two remaining petitions, which
properly pertain to the heavenly life3 iu which he has con·
sulted our dulness. We ara commanded to ask “our bread,’'
that we may be content with the portion which our heavenly
Father deigns to allot us, nor practise any illicit srts for the
love of lucra. In tha mean time, it must be understood that it
becomes ours by a title of donatiou; because neither our in·
dustry, nor our labour, nor our hands, (aa is observed by Mo·
ses,)(q) acquire any thing forus of themselves, when unat·
tended by the Divina blessing; and that even an abnndance
of bread would not be of the least service to us, unless it were
by the Divina power converted into nourishment. And there-
fore this liberality of God is equally aa necessary ιο the rich as
to the poor3 for though their barus and cellars were full, they
would faint with hunger and thirst, unless through his good-
ness they enjoyed their food. The expression “this day,”
or “day by day,” as‘it isin the other Evangelist, and the
epithet deity, restrain the inordinate desire of transitory things,
with which we are often violently inflamari, and which leads
to other evils; since if we have a greater abundance, we fondly
lavish it away iu pleasure, delights‚ ostentation, and other kinds
of luxury. Therefore we are enjoined to ask only as much as
will supply our necessity, and as it ware for the present day,
with this confidenee, that our heavenly Father‚ after having
fedus to-day, will not fail us ιο-ιιιοιιοιι. Whatever affluence,
then, we possess, even when our barns and cellars are full, yet
it behoves us always to ask for our daily bread; because it
must be considered as an undeniable truth, that all property is
nothing, any further than the Lord, by tha effusions of his
favour, blesses it with continual improvement; and that even
what we bave in our possession is not our own, any further thau
