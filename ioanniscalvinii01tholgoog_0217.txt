ambiguity of the expression might have given occasion sor

surround us, and promises that they shall be “raised in incor-

pressly, unless lie hed held his own skin in his hand.’' Nor will
any cavil evade the declarationes halah, cited by the aposita,
respecting Christ as the future Judge of the world: “ As 1 live,
saith the Lord, every knee shall bow to me ; ” (r) for he plainly
declares to the persons addressed by him, that they shall be
obliged to give an account of their lives; which would not be

. reasonable, is new bodies were to be placed at the tribunal.

There is no obscurity in the language os Daniel: “Many os
them that sleep in the dust ol the earth shall awalre, some to
everlasting lise, and some to shame and everlasting eon-
tempt.'’ (s) For God does not collect fresh materiale from the
four elementa lor the fabrication of men, but calls the dead out
of their sepulchres. And this the plainest reason dictatas
For it death, which originated in the fall os man, be adventi·
tious, and not necessary to our nature, tho restoration effected
by Christ belongs to the same body which was thus rendered
mortal. From the ridicule of the Atheniens, when Paul assert-
ed the resurrection, it is easy to infer the nature of his doc-
trine ; and that ridicule isos no small weight sor the confirmation
of our saith. 'I'he injunction os Christ also is worthy of atton·
tion: “ Fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to
lrill the soul; but rather sear him which is able to destroy both
soul and body in hell.’' (t) For there would be no reason sor
this sear, it‘ the body which we now cany about were not
liable to punishment. Another of Christ's declarationsis equal-
ly plain: “The honr is coming, in the which all that are in
the graves shall hear his voice, and shall come forth, they that
have done good, unto the resurrection of lise, and they that
have done evil, unto the resurrectiones damnation.'' (u) Shall
we say that souls rest iu graves, and will there hear the voice
of Christ, aad not rather that bodies at his command will return
to the vigour they had lost? Besides, if we are to receive new
bodies, where will be the conformity between the Head and
members? Christ rose; was it by making himself a new
body? No, but according to his prediction, “Destroy this
temple, and iu three days Ι will raise it up.” (s) The mortel
body which he before possessed, he again assumed. For
it would have eonduced bnt little to our benefit, if there
had been a substitution ol a new body, and an annihilation of
