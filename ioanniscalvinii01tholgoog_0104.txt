faith or repentauce, united with ardent zeal and well-regulated
desires. We have said, that although prayer is a familiar
intercourse between God and pious meu, yet reverencc and
modesty must be preserved, that we may not give a loose to
all our wishes, nor even in our desires enceed the Divina per·
mission; and to prevent the majesty of God being lessened in
our view, our minds must bc raised to a pure and holy venera·
tion os him. This no man has ever performed with the purity
required; for, to say nothing of the multitude, how many com-
plaints of David savour of intemperance of spirit! not that he
would designedly remonstrate with God, or murmurat his
judgments; buthe saints in consequence of his infirmity, and
finds no better consolation than to pour his sorrows into the
Diviue bosom. Moreover, God bears with our lisping, and
pardons our ignorance, whenever any inconsiderate expressions
escape us, and certainly without this indulgence there could
be no freedom of prayer. But though it was David's intention
to submit himself wholly to the Diviue will, and his patience
in prayer was equal to his desire of obtaining his requests, yet
we sometimes perceive the appearance and ebullition of turbu-
lent passions, very inconsistent with the first rule we have laid
down. We may discover, particularly from the conclusion of
the thirty-ninth psalm, with what vehemeuce of grief this holy
man was hurried away beyond all the bounds of propriety.
“O spate me (says he) before Ι go hence, and be no more.'’ (y)
One might be ready to say, that the man, being in despair,
desires nothing but the removal of God’s hand, that he may
putrefy in his own iniquities and miserias. He does not intend
to rush into intemperance of lauguage‚ or, as is usual with the
reprobate, desire God to depart from him; he only complains
that he cannot bear the Divino wrath. ln these temptations,
also, the saints often drop petitione, not sufficiently conformablc
to the rule of God's word, aud without due reflectiou on what
is right and proper. All prayers pollutcd with these blemishes
deserve to be rejected; yet is the saints moum‚ correct them-
sclves, and return to themselves again,God forgives them. Thus
they offend likewise against the second rule3 because they fre-
quently have to contend witlr their own indifference3 nor do
their poverty and misery sufficiently incite them to seriousness
of devotion. Now, their minds frequently wander, and are almost
absorbed in vanity3 aud they also need pardou in this respect, lest
languid, or mutilated, or interrupted and desultory prayers should
meet with a repulse. God has naturally impressed the minds
of men with a conviction that prayers require to be attended
with an elevation of beart. Hence the ceremouy of elevating
