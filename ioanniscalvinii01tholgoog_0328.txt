often appealed 10 the bishop of Rome; and he also attempted

shall say nothing of the East, or of Graece ς but it appears that
the bishops of France strenuously resisted him, when he dis-
covered an inclination to usurp authority over them. ln Africa,
this subject occasioned a long controversy. For when the
0011001101 1111011110,οῐ which Augustino was present, had de·
nounced excommunication against all who should appeal beyond
the sea, the bishop of Rome endeavoured to get this decree
rescinded He sent legates to state that this privilege had been
given 10 him by the Council 01 Ν100. The legates produced
certain acts which they alleged to 10 the acts of the Oouncil of
Nice, and which they had brought from the archives of their
Ohurch. They were resisted by the Africana, who denied that
the bishop of Rome ought to be credited in his own cause.
They therefore determined to send to Constantinople, and other
cities 01 Greece, 10 obtain copies liable to less suspicion. lt
was found that these copies contained no such passages as the
Roman legates 1011 pretended. 80 110 1100100 was confirmed,
which had 1011011 110 supreme coguizance 01 appeals from the
bishop 01 Rome. This transaction discovered the scandalous
impudence 01 the Roman ponttff. For when he had fraudu·
leutly substituted the coancil 01 Sardis for that 01 Nice, hc was
disgracefully detected in a manifest falsehood. But still greater
wickedness aud effrontery were betrayed by 111000 who added
to the acts 01 110 council a forged epistle‚ in which a bishop of
Carthage condemns the arrogance 01 his predecessor, Aurelius,
101 having dared to withdraw himself from obedience 10 the
apostolic see, presente the submission 01 himself and his Ohurch,
and humhly supplicates for pardon. These are the glorious
monuments of antiquity upon which the majesty of the Roman
see is founded, while, under the pretext 01 antiquity, they
advance such puerile falsehoods, as require nottho least pene·
tration to detect. ‘¹ Aurelius,'’ says this famousepistle, “elated
with diabolical audacity and obstinacy, was a rebel against
Christ aud St. Peter, and therefore deserved to he anathema·
tized.'' But what said Augustino? What said all the fathers
who were present at the Gouncil of Milevuml But what
necessity is there for spending many words to refute that stupid
fabrication, which even the Romanists themselves, if they have
any modesty left, cannot look 01 without being exceedingly
ashamed? 80 Gratian, the compiler of the decretal, - whether
from wickedness or ignorancc 1 know not, — after having 10011011
that canon, that those who appeeled beyond the sea should 10
